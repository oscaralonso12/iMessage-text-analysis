As a family ,303,5.68015E+17,1
U should be,303,5.68015E+17,1
because my dad was the one who basically coerced her to come back,303,5.68015E+17,0
"She’s young tho she doesn’t get it, MAKE HER UNDERSTAND THOUGH",303,5.68015E+17,1
But in the end it’s not going to help her ,303,5.68015E+17,0
I can’t make her understand ,303,5.68015E+17,0
She is hard shell to crack ,303,5.68015E+17,0
and she’s manipulative ,303,5.68015E+17,0
What did ur dad do to make her comeback?,303,5.68015E+17,1
Lol dang,303,5.68015E+17,1
and she always gets what she wants in the end,303,5.68015E+17,0
He kept calling her and calling her basically begging her to come back ,303,5.68015E+17,0
I’m sure u have tried to make her understand what she’s doing is wrong but u gotta keep trying!!!,303,5.68015E+17,1
What did ur mom say,303,5.68015E+17,1
And so she did but she came back because her stuff got stolen and she was too stingy to spend her money ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Wwoowwww,303,5.68015E+17,1
Yo,303,5.68015E+17,1

WTH is wrong with her omg lol,303,5.68015E+17,1
Maybe she wants attention????,303,5.68015E+17,1
ALOT OF THINGS. and so the problems get worse because my dad brought her back without communicating with my mom ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Ooooooooo,303,5.68015E+17,1
oh no she gets too much attention ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Yikes ,303,5.68015E+17,1
So it’s just problems everywhere,303,5.68015E+17,0
:-(,303,5.68015E+17,1
ITLL BE OKAY YAMZ,303,5.68015E+17,1
Look,303,5.68015E+17,1
it’s too much to explain but I almost wish she wasn’t here and I feel bad for saying it but ,303,5.68015E+17,0
She knows u guys love her but if she wants to leave u can’t do anything about it I guess :/ ,303,5.68015E+17,1
It’s her choice ,303,5.68015E+17,1
Probably not the best choice but,303,5.68015E+17,1
Don’t get too caught up in it :/ I know she’s ur sister and u love her but if she doesn’t wanna be there then what can u do???,303,5.68015E+17,1
Yea she left but now she’s back like she owns the place ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Acting like nothing ever happened ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Smh,303,5.68015E+17,1
I don’t want her to be here ,303,5.68015E+17,0
That’s what getting u upset?? Her acting like nothing happened huh,303,5.68015E+17,1
Yamz don’t think like that :/,303,5.68015E+17,1

I want her to be here but she actually doesn’t ,303,5.68015E+17,0
and hats why she left,303,5.68015E+17,0
But my dad goes and gets her,303,5.68015E+17,0
my sister says she’s gonna change ,303,5.68015E+17,0
That’s what dads do!!!!,303,5.68015E+17,1
They gotta keep the fam together!!!,303,5.68015E+17,1
Honestly u and ur parents should have a group talk with her ,303,5.68015E+17,1
U guys all need to get on the same page ,303,5.68015E+17,1
Yes but then my mom and I are the people that deal with her bratty behavior ,303,5.68015E+17,0
my dad brings her home but doesn’t do anything about her ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Ur dad has to be on the same page to then!!!,303,5.68015E+17,1
And so what I’m really mad is that my parents aren’t on the same page,303,5.68015E+17,0
Yeah that’s frustrating ,303,5.68015E+17,1
Let them know!!!,303,5.68015E+17,1
my dad especially isn’t on the same page,303,5.68015E+17,0
Tell ur dad how u feel about this,303,5.68015E+17,1
So the what I’m mad about ,303,5.68015E+17,0

My mom and dad are fighting ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Oh man,303,5.68015E+17,1
so thy aren’t talking,303,5.68015E+17,0

Dude everything’s just messed up ,303,5.68015E+17,0
It’s gonna be okay I promise ,303,5.68015E+17,1
They just gotta get on the same page ,303,5.68015E+17,1
COMMUNICATION ,303,5.68015E+17,1
I tried being the one that holds everything together even talked to both of my parents telling them they have to be on the same page so my sister takes them seriously ,303,5.68015E+17,0
but everyone’s just stuck on their own opinions ,303,5.68015E+17,0
Yyeesssss,303,5.68015E+17,1
Oommgggg,303,5.68015E+17,1
My parents suck at communication ,303,5.68015E+17,0
That’s honestly why ur sister is acting like this ,303,5.68015E+17,1
I just need them to fix that,303,5.68015E+17,0
Cause ur parents aren’t on the same page,303,5.68015E+17,1
Yeaa i know that,303,5.68015E+17,0
That’s why I don’t blame her ,303,5.68015E+17,0
You can’t really fix it,303,5.68015E+17,1
THEY NEED TO FIX IT,303,5.68015E+17,1
like she’s messed up but the damage is further because of us ,303,5.68015E+17,0
You should still blame her lol wth ,303,5.68015E+17,1

He should just let her be free,303,5.68016E+17,0
Not ur dad begging her,303,5.68016E+17,1

I know ,303,5.68016E+17,0
But it’s not a good one,303,5.68016E+17,0

True true ,303,5.72049E+17,1

he was super manipulative ,303,5.72049E+17,0

This is a disorder called fictitious disorder by proxy,303,5.76122E+17,0

and control ,303,5.76122E+17,0
Okay okay ,303,5.76122E+17,1

"I see why u think that. Because ur opinions and thought are primarily influence by societal views. Society says a lot of things. And societal views change constantly. They’re constructed by people’s opinions, and those opinions often derive from their internal desires ",303,5.79048E+17,0

She’s well spoken btw lol,303,5.79045E+17,1
So I get what she’s saying. She’s saying that god created us in a certain way for a purpose. That the purpose is for men and women to be partners and that’s it. And we should follow the rules of God because he created us and who are we to disobey the creator. ,303,5.79045E+17,1
https://youtu.be/u-6a6kiRgYg,303,5.79022E+17,0
She also says a lot of more things but that was one of her main points,303,5.79045E+17,1
"With that being saaiiiddd, I still feel like it’s okay lolol. For two reasons. The first one is I’m still concerned about what Jesus has to say about this. Second, is that marriage is a basic human right. How are we going to take away a basic human right from someone?",303,5.79045E+17,1
Oh here we go,303,,

I’m about to listen to the 2nd part lolol,303,5.79045E+17,1
so of course marriage is a basic human right but Christ for this right for his original design between a man and a woman ,303,5.79048E+17,0
Sorrry typos on the last txt,303,5.79048E+17,0
Lol ,303,5.79022E+17,0
Yes yes. Jackie also says that we should put our desires aside and put Jesus first. And I get that. But idk it just doesn’t seem like the right thing to do to not let someone get married ,303,5.79048E+17,1
But then Jackie would probably say it’s not up to us to judge what’s right and wrong lolol,303,5.79049E+17,1

Okay okay,303,5.79022E+17,1
U right ,303,5.79049E+17,1
But u get what I’m saying tho,303,5.79049E+17,1
"If it were for me, I wouldn’t care if they did. I think people should do what they want. But if we let some people do what they want, it gets scary. Bc humans are crooked dude ",303,5.79049E+17,0
it has the verses on homosexuality ,303,5.79022E+17,0
ok say we do let people do as they want ,303,5.79049E+17,0

"Marriage is a basic human right, as you say",303,5.79049E+17,0
and New Testament ,303,5.79022E+17,0
I think humans for the most part are good ppl,303,5.79049E+17,1
"but what about those who say, well if marriage is a human right and I’m allowed to love who I love then let me marry a younger girl below the ages of 18 because I want that ",303,5.79049E+17,0
Besides love is love ,303,5.79049E+17,0
I will read and listen to all these,303,5.79022E+17,1

I’m 22 and idk what’s going on lolol,303,5.79049E+17,1
Yes but it doesn’t matter right ,303,5.79049E+17,0
Paul the apostle,303,5.79024E+17,0
bc some people are gonna push for that,303,5.79049E+17,0
And love is love and if parents are ok with that then let it happen,303,5.79049E+17,0
You should also read about Paul's story,303,5.79024E+17,0

people are always gonna push toward something that fulfills their desires ,303,5.79049E+17,0
So you’re saying it’ll avalanche into some crazy stuff if we let gay people get married,303,5.79049E+17,1
Well I’m not saying gay marriage is the culprit ,303,5.79049E+17,0
People are the culprit?,303,5.79049E+17,1
That’s next I think,303,5.79024E+17,1
 Yes,303,5.79049E+17,0
Crazy ppl?,303,5.79049E+17,1

"But I fee like if someone wanted to marry a toaster or their dog, we would stop that lol",303,5.79049E+17,1
Acts right?,303,5.79024E+17,1
I’m trying to get you to realize that the core of all the issues here is not any of those things it is people in that people are not good and they need Jesus,303,5.79049E+17,0
That’s the core issue ,303,5.79049E+17,0
People ,303,5.79049E+17,0
And when people are faced with the truth and the light of Jesus Christ then all these things and desires are illuminated and then people realize they are in the wrong ,303,5.79049E+17,0
"Okay ur not gonna like this but, in that link there wasn’t anything for the gospels ",303,5.79024E+17,1
"See idk about that, I always thought most people are decent human beings lol",303,5.79049E+17,1
Of course they’re not perfect ,303,5.79049E+17,1
Well no ,303,5.79049E+17,0
But they’re decent ,303,5.79049E+17,1

Bundy ,303,5.79049E+17,0
He was nice ,303,5.79049E+17,0
I said most people tho,303,5.79049E+17,1
And I’m sure if you and I met him People would have never imagined that he was a serial killer,303,5.79049E+17,0
Ted Bundy is a few out of 7 billion ppl,303,5.79049E+17,1
Yea well I’m sure there is lots of people out there ,303,5.79049E+17,0
But the reality of our human condition is not good ,303,5.79049E+17,0
"Yes we are naturally greedy and all those things I get that, but I still feel like people will help people at the end of the day",303,5.79049E+17,1
"And though they are nice for a bit, lnevitably they are bound to hit a breaking point",303,5.79049E+17,0
And that’s where I go back to the conversation I had with you when we had breakfast about doesn’t matter how good you are or how nice you are or what good deed supposedly you do if you don’t have christ those good deeds mean nothing,303,5.79049E+17,0
There’s a verse about that,303,5.79049E+17,1
"The gospels focus are one thing, to tell you about God and Jesus. A gospels are about Jesus coming to earth and dying for our sins. If you understand that story and if you accept Jesus in your heart then you are choosing to turn away from things that are immoral. ",303,5.79025E+17,0
Because someone who doesn’t have Jesus isn’t always going to sacrifice his time and self or others,303,5.79049E+17,0
I have it saved ,303,5.79049E+17,1

Because when there is a real trial where people have to survive not a lot of people are going to be looking out for others,303,5.79049E+17,0
"Jesus didn’t come down to just talk about homosexuality, he came to bring good news to the poor, the sick, the hurting, and the sinners. ",303,5.79025E+17,0
lol yea the Lord looks at the heart,303,5.79049E+17,0
and tight there he was talking about David ,303,5.79049E+17,0
So you’re saying good deeds only count if you love Jesus?,303,5.79049E+17,1
And he died for people who are same sex attracted and offers a plan of salvation for them. So yeah though Jesus does not specifically say “don’t practice homosexuality” it is implied through the way he states we should live ,303,5.79025E+17,0
Not necessarily ,303,5.79049E+17,0
I’m saying the continuation of good deeds till we die count more ,303,5.79049E+17,0

"When people asked Jesus about marriage, He told them to remember what Genesis said about God’s plan for marriage. So read Matthew 19:1-12",303,5.79025E+17,0
I think I remember that ,303,5.79025E+17,1
He says to marry your wife or something like that right ,303,5.79025E+17,1
Yep,303,5.79025E+17,0
Okay I read it,303,5.79025E+17,1
But it doesn’t ssaaayyyy anything about homosexuality ,303,5.79025E+17,1
Just says men and women become one flesh,303,5.79025E+17,1
It’s like Therefore a man shall leave there father and mother and join to their wife ,303,5.79025E+17,0
Yes,303,5.79025E+17,1
It also talks about divorce lol,303,5.79025E+17,1
yeah because that’s his plan ,303,5.79025E+17,0
marriage is between man and women,303,5.79025E+17,0
What happens if a husband or wife die? Can they remarry or is that not allowed? Lolol,303,5.79025E+17,1
Yes,303,5.79025E+17,1
He never stated oh man shall leave his home to join to his partner,303,5.79025E+17,0
HAHA,303,5.79025E+17,1
N he specifically states who,303,5.79025E+17,0
True true,303,5.79025E+17,1
A woman,303,5.79025E+17,0
And this plan has been established since the beginning,303,5.79025E+17,0
When he created Adam and Eve,303,5.79025E+17,0
Liked “What happens if a husband or wife die? Can they remarry or is that not allowed? Lolol”,303,5.79025E+17,0
0c446803b10fc5f4ff15395eb0973eb06a7c9ff71c126050fee343f454eb2080,0,,
Yeah you can remarry if your spouse dies ,303,5.79025E+17,0
So you’re saying Jesus is implying that homosexuality shouldn’t be practiced ,303,5.79025E+17,1
"Yes, he’s implying that",303,5.79025E+17,0
Hhmmmm,303,5.79025E+17,1
Well then,303,5.79025E+17,1
It’s even implied in the way he designed our bodies ,303,5.79025E+17,0
Idk I need to think about this lolol,303,5.79025E+17,1
Yes I understand that ,303,5.79025E+17,1
you cannot procreate with same sex ,303,5.79025E+17,0
and that’s for a reason,303,5.79025E+17,0
But I guess my concern is like Jesus wasn’t specific about it,303,5.79025E+17,1
Like he didn’t directly say it,303,5.79025E+17,1
The Bible doesn’t say don’t do drugs now does it,303,5.79025E+17,0
so why do I know it’s bad ,303,5.79025E+17,0
There wasn’t drugs back then tho,303,5.79025E+17,1
Should I do drugs then bc he didn’t say it specifically ,303,5.79025E+17,0
Hahah I’m sure there was things that made people trip back then ,303,5.79025E+17,0
LOL,303,5.79025E+17,1

Still should I do drugs anyway ,303,5.79025E+17,0
it’s new thing ,303,5.79025E+17,0
And bible doesn’t say It,303,5.79025E+17,0

Last q of the day,303,5.80778E+17,1
Yea,303,5.80778E+17,0
LOL,303,5.80778E+17,1
Okay so,303,5.80778E+17,1
U have no relationship with Mary right?,303,5.80778E+17,1
She’s just like there,303,5.80778E+17,1
Virgin Mary ,303,5.80778E+17,1
Isn’t it important to have a relationship with Mary? Not worship her but just have a relationship?,303,5.80778E+17,1
Yea I don’t worship la virgencita ,303,5.80778E+17,0
She’s the mum of the dude who died for us,303,5.80778E+17,1
What does have a relationship mean to you tho,303,5.80778E+17,0
She’s a cool person lol idk,303,5.80778E+17,1
"like having a relationship with her, how does that look like ",303,5.80778E+17,0
Yea and for that she is great,303,5.80778E+17,0
She was chosen ,303,5.80778E+17,0
I don’t really pray to her but I like her,303,5.80778E+17,1
To give birth to Jesus ,303,5.80778E+17,0
Yes,303,5.80778E+17,1
I know that part ,303,5.80778E+17,1
she is a vesse that was chosen for a purpose ,303,5.80778E+17,0
Vessel*,303,5.80778E+17,0
just like you,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
just like me ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
So it couldn’t been anyone?,303,5.80778E+17,1
Could’ve*,303,5.80778E+17,1
Cause this how I see it,303,5.80778E+17,1
If U have a best friend wouldn’t u want to get to know their parents?,303,5.80778E+17,1
We can do that with Jesus too right?,303,5.80778E+17,1
Just have a relationship there,303,5.80778E+17,1
I think it could have been another woman. But it wasn’t because Mary was chosen for various reasons. ,303,5.80778E+17,0
I think that I can be interested in getting to know who she was ,303,5.80778E+17,0
But not worship her,303,5.80778E+17,1
Just getting to know her?,303,5.80778E+17,1
And in that way see wow Mary was an amazing woman of God. I can learn from her. Just like I have learned from David and from Esther in the Bible and from Daniel and etc. ,303,5.80778E+17,0
I see I see,303,5.80778E+17,1
"Here’s the thing, it’s almost a natural instinct for people to want to worship something that is greater than themselves. People sometimes want to worship the moon and the stars for giving them sunlight and beauty and all these things. But those aren’t the things we should worship, it’s the creator who should be worshipped. ",303,5.80778E+17,0
Truueee,303,5.80778E+17,1
U right u right ,303,5.80778E+17,1
so I understand why people want to worship Mary ,303,5.80778E+17,0
after all she gave birth to Jesus ,303,5.80778E+17,0
But we gotta focus on the creator not the creations ,303,5.80778E+17,1
that must make her worthy of praise right ,303,5.80778E+17,0
Yeesss,303,5.80778E+17,1
but the one who is to be praised and worshipped and be given the Glory is God. ,303,5.80778E+17,0
That’s right,303,5.80778E+17,1
Okay I see now ,303,5.80778E+17,1
So just use Mary as an example of how good we can be but we should only worship god,303,5.80778E+17,1
Yea exactly ,303,5.80778E+17,0
But it’s okay to get to know her tho,303,5.80778E+17,1
Got iitttttt,303,5.80778E+17,1
how does getting to know her more look like for you tho,303,5.80778E+17,0

Yes yes exactly like that,303,5.80778E+17,1
Yep. Go read about her ,303,5.80778E+17,0
It’s cause I’ve been talking to my parents about becoming a Christian and they’re like way more catholic than I thought LOL,303,5.80778E+17,1
They’re okay with it btw it’s just I didn’t know how catholic they actually were,303,5.80778E+17,1

"But I’m glad they didn’t force it on me u know, cause I actually want to seek Jesus by myself and I think that’s good",303,5.80778E+17,1
LOL NO,303,5.80778E+17,1
"Loved “But I’m glad they didn’t force it on me u know, cause I actually want to seek Jesus by myself and I think that’s good”",303,5.80778E+17,0
that’s good to hear ,303,5.80778E+17,0
and that’s how it should be ,303,5.80779E+17,0
They say do whatever I think is more comfortable  ,303,5.80779E+17,1
And I said I like Christian better than Catholics and they don’t mind lol,303,5.80779E+17,1

I know 😂,303,5.80779E+17,1
And it’s unfortunately just passed down by culture without actual revelation or understanding of the reason why they do that,303,5.80779E+17,0
When I tell her I’m about to drive to Downey.. “Ahorita prendo la vela”,303,5.80779E+17,1
Y do they do that??,303,5.80779E+17,1

The girl speaking is someone I admire. She became a Christian by herself in her own room. All she had was a bible that she started reading and she fell in love with Jesus and asked him to come into his heart.,303,5.8078E+17,0

"And that’s how I feel rn, when she talked about how she use to have her wrestles with god",303,5.80798E+17,1
I feel like I’m wrestling with him rn lolol trying to get answers and have my concerns figured out,303,5.80798E+17,1
"It’s a really nice video, I liked it. I’m about to watch the second one",303,5.80798E+17,1
"Yea and it’s ok to wrestle with God, he wants you to ",303,5.808E+17,0
The best way over is through. So if you wanna figure out things and settle your concerns you gotta wrestle with it a little. Bring those concerns to the Lord. And Read scripture. ,303,5.808E+17,0
The second video I think is more of her story ,303,5.808E+17,0
and how she came to Christ ,303,5.808E+17,0

"That is understandable that you feel that way. it just feels better to feel like we control our lives. And you do have control to a certain extent-You have free will. You have a choice. God does not force you to believe in him. But when you do chose to believe and when you surrender your life to him you will experience an inexplicable peace. So when you used to put your worth on things of this world- a world that will fail you time and time again, you now rest in the security of a perfect creator who relentlessly pursues you and loves you deeply.

Ultimately it’s reasonable to say we indeed aren’t in control of our lives. Tomorrow I may head out to go run an errand and Some distracted driver may hit me and kill me. I can’t control that. Or maybe there will be a natural disaster that wipes our our small city. We think we have time, but truth of matter is that life can end in a snap. On day your living, the next your not. The only reason I’m not anxious about any of these things is because I trust the Lord Is in control and that he protects me wherever I go.",303,5.80808E+17,0

"You’re right, I think I just need more faith. That’ll come, I know it will. It just takes time, at least for me haha. The important thing is that at least I’m seeking it. It’s just about taking the leap and surrendering. I’ll come around tho",303,5.80809E+17,1

yea I know there are some people who don’t believe in the trinity but we do ,303,5.81758E+17,0
what do you think ,303,5.81758E+17,0
I believe in the trinity ,303,5.81759E+17,1
It was a little confusing at first ,303,5.81759E+17,1
Like they’re all 3 in 1,303,5.81759E+17,1
But now I understand it some more lolol,303,5.81759E+17,1
Yea i would describe it like an egg shell,303,5.81796E+17,0
these three parts to it ,303,5.81796E+17,0
"The shell, egg whites, and the yolk ",303,5.81796E+17,0
but all together it’s an egg,303,5.81796E+17,0
In the trinity the father son and Holy Spirit are that 3 in one like you said.,303,5.81797E+17,0
"Ha, that’s a solid analogy!! I like that ",303,5.81797E+17,1

Quick question ,303,5.82325E+17,1
I was talking with grace ,303,5.82325E+17,1
Tell me what u think about this,303,5.82325E+17,1
So what do u think if grace and Eric got married but instead of moving in right away they lived apart until they both had real jobs ,303,5.82325E+17,1
What,303,5.82325E+17,0
is that what they are doing?,303,5.82325E+17,0
I think they can’t married at all. Marriage means ur committed and adulting. So if you’re married you’re able to live on your own. ,303,5.82325E+17,0
But if for severe financial reasons they need to stay at home living with parents then sure but idk ,303,5.82325E+17,0
Why what do you think ,303,5.82325E+17,0
Lol no they’re not doing that but I suggested it to her if they have a hard time finding an apartment ,303,5.82325E+17,1
She said I was dumb LOL,303,5.82325E+17,1
Lol no obviously theyre getting married bc they wanna live together and do it ,303,5.82325E+17,0
🤢,303,5.82325E+17,1
so they don’t have self control to live apart ,303,5.82325E+17,0

Smh,303,5.82325E+17,1

"I hung out with my friend Jeraun and he told me he got baptized out of no where and then I told him I wanted commit to Jesus as well but I had a problem. I told him how can the church dislike racism yet they are against homosexuality. Then he explained to me they they aren’t the same. Maybe it was just multiple people telling me at once idk lol. But on the drive here I had a lot of time to think and that’s when I came to this conclusion: God is fair and just. He doesn’t forget about anyone. I’m starting to realize that homosexuality isn’t a natural thing. God designed us this way for a reason. God is perfect, he doesn’t make mistakes. But the most important thing that made me change my mind is just remembering that God doesn’t forget about anyone. He likes homosexuals as much as anyone else. 
Also, another thing too is that I gotta grow up 😂. I live in a very liberal place so I was too worried about how people might view me because of this new faith that I have. But I know I shouldn’t worry about that. My faith should be stronger than that. And it’s starting to become that way. Like ur parents said lol, I can’t be worried about the earthly things. I am proud to be on this path, no matter how ppl might view me. I want to be a good representation of Jesus so maybe other people, especially here in this liberal place, can see that Christianity is a beautiful thing and for them to get saved too!!

"MY NOTE

“Before I forget :

My mom sent me a voicemail-she was emotional. she was saying things that made it seem that I had left my home. she gave me this verse John 3:1 And it’s about how like one is joyful over the fact that their kids are in the truth. And she said that for her it’s the opposite because her kids are NOT in the truth. She was referring to me and my sister.

I think my dad told her that I said “no one is going to stop me”. I NEVER SAID THAT. but maybe said something that was more like me making my own decision. But if there something I do remember correctly is that my dad didn’t let me talk.

My mom thinks I am going against the will of my parents. That I am disobeying. She thinks I had underlying plans to leave all along. My mom says that all the things I have worked for are for nothing. She thinks I played her and that all that time that I spent trying to text her and build trust with her was all a lie. Apparently this was one of the nesting plans I had to get my way.

AND THIS WAS ALL BECAUSE I MADE A DECISION TO STAY THE NIGHT BC I WANT TO BE PRACTICAL. NOT BECAUSE I AM DRINKING OR BEING RATCHET OR PERVERTING MYSELF.

Her voice memo was manipulative in a way. She tried to guilt trip me but I did not fall for a thing because last time I remember I didn’t leave home. I just made one small decision.  And I do not regret it. I am not in sin. And if I am Lord forgive me, but this has gotten out of hand.",303,5.85962E+17,0

"All revolutions r hard lol this is why ur doing, finally standing up",303,5.85962E+17,1
Yeah no ur not in the wrong ,303,5.85962E+17,1
They’re really trying to be manipulative ,303,5.85962E+17,1
But apparently I am because I disobeyed a clear order to not stay ,303,5.85962E+17,0
Smh they didn’t even hear u out,303,5.85962E+17,1
I don’t think they realize they are manipulative ,303,5.85962E+17,0
That’s the problem ,303,5.85962E+17,0
Man :/,303,5.85962E+17,1
They think they are doing right by using the word of god and justifying their views ,303,5.85962E+17,0
And not trying to understand me ,303,5.85962E+17,0
That isn’t right ,303,5.85962E+17,1
It shouldn’t be like this man,303,5.85962E+17,1
Yamili I know this is ur battle but if u ever need me to talk to ur mom or something ,303,5.85962E+17,1

Ok I wanna see if I can change their perspective first ,303,5.85962E+17,0
Yeah,303,5.85962E+17,1
I think u should talk to them first ,303,5.85962E+17,1
Then you can share your perspective to them ,303,5.85962E+17,0
Then I can come in and talk to them if need be,303,5.85962E+17,1

Tell them their duty is a disservice to u,303,5.8616E+17,1

It’s a lot for them ,303,5.86161E+17,0
They are not used to not being in control ,303,5.86161E+17,0
U gotta make them realize that,303,5.86161E+17,1
Even though they have never been in control ,303,5.86161E+17,0

How is it ,303,5.86452E+17,0
Also I haven’t talked to my parents ,303,5.86452E+17,0
It was awesome! He talked about how he came to faith. Then he talked about how he didn’t see himself as a “true Christian” and how he overcame those concerns. Also his fav gospel book is Matthew because that’s where the sermon on the mount is which is also my fav book for the same reason :-). His words of encouragement strengthen my faith which is good,303,5.86454E+17,1

It would be interesting to have a convo with my parents about that ,303,5.86454E+17,0

i do believe ,303,,

That too many vaccinations at once are not tolerated by little human babies ,303,5.8762E+17,0
Believe what,303,5.8762E+17,1
And so therefore ,303,5.8762E+17,0
I kinda go with that ,303,5.8762E+17,1
I recommend vaccines to be spread out,303,5.8762E+17,0
Sounds reasonable ,303,5.8762E+17,1
Not too spread out tho,303,5.8762E+17,1
Healthy balance ,303,5.8762E+17,1
Just to allow the baby to grow a bit first before they are infiltrated with inactivated bacteria ,303,5.8762E+17,0
Of course ,303,5.8762E+17,0
It has to be within the first year and a half ,303,5.8762E+17,0
Oh dang ,303,5.8762E+17,1
Well I’ll make sure to keep that in mind whenever I have kids I guess 😂,303,5.8762E+17,1

but this is what got my attention ,303,5.88715E+17,0
What ,303,5.88715E+17,1
He said that apes didn’t not evolve into humans rather humans began to “de-evolve” ,303,5.88715E+17,0
Oh,303,5.88715E+17,1
Like the other way around,303,5.88716E+17,1
Humans to apes ,303,5.88716E+17,1
"meaning humans basically degraded into ape looking features, like more animal looking ",303,5.88716E+17,0

He said cause of sin??,303,5.88716E+17,1
What do u think about that,303,5.88716E+17,1
And the reason why he said that was because there is actually an instance in the Bible were a human turns into an animal ,303,5.88716E+17,0

Let me guess,303,5.88716E+17,1

Didn’t u tell me about him,303,5.88716E+17,1
Im the book of Daniel ,303,5.88716E+17,0
I think I did ,303,5.88716E+17,0
Or was that another thing ,303,5.88716E+17,1
I don’t member,303,5.88716E+17,0
OT crazy,303,5.88716E+17,1
He was humbled by Hod because he was boasting about his power and achievements and lost his sanity ,303,5.88716E+17,0
He lived like an animal for several years ,303,5.88716E+17,0
Then he became an animal?,303,5.88716E+17,1
Dang,303,5.88716E+17,1
It’s in Daniel chapter 4,303,5.88716E+17,0
Ima look into that,303,5.88716E+17,1
But even still ,303,5.88716E+17,0
In his animal state ,303,5.88716E+17,0
He looked up finally an admitted and acknowledged God was actually the most powerful ,303,5.88716E+17,0
And he turned back I think ,303,5.88716E+17,0
Nice nice ,303,5.88716E+17,1
That’s a solid story,303,5.88716E+17,1

I will,303,5.88716E+17,1
Yes,303,5.88716E+17,1
It’s also one of the things I struggle with tbh. Sometimes I fee like since I believe in evolution my faith isn’t good enough :/ I’m actually gonna talk to my pastor about it soon,303,5.88716E+17,1
"Like I believe the Bible, especially the OT, is the truth but not the literally truth u know what I mean",303,5.88716E+17,1

Gene expression and inhibition **,303,5.88716E+17,0
What,303,5.888E+17,1

"“God’s word is alive and working. It is sharper than the sharpest sword and cuts all the way into us. It cuts deep to the place where the soul and the spirit are joined. God’s word cuts to the center of our joints and our bones. It judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts. Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God. He can clearly see all things. Everything is open before him. And to him we must explain the way we have lived.”

Did you catch how it cuts down to the center of our joints and our bones? Other bible versions say bone marrow. And guess what the bone marrow does?  It makes new red blood cells and other cells. Meaning it regenerates even our cells and cleans them ,303,5.88723E+17,0

"Back to the point you made about how God crested Adam from dust and how that’s a metaphor, I don’t think it is. ",303,5.88727E+17,0
We literally are dust. Our skin flakes contribute to dust ,303,5.88727E+17,0
And there are many verses in scripture that say “from dust you were formed to dust you will return”,303,5.88727E+17,0
Genesis 3:19  genesis 18:27 job 30:19,303,5.88727E+17,0

It pretty much says that genes play a part of people being gay but it’s not the whole story ,303,5.88799E+17,1
ALL THESE THINGS COMING OUT BRUH,303,5.88799E+17,1

It’s a choice huh,303,5.888E+17,1
Or that they’re not right mentally,303,5.888E+17,1
I also believe genes do have something to do with people being gay later. Just like what I had told you about how people’s decisions right now are making changes to their DNA and it gets passed down.,303,5.888E+17,0
Butttt,303,5.888E+17,0

Such as parents or friends or culture ,303,5.888E+17,0

I pinky promise I’ll try to be unbiased as possible lol even tho that video up there is kind of based ,303,6.00559E+17,1

Loved “I actually probably need you to feed me I for ”,303,6.00559E+17,1
What did u think of the video??,303,6.00627E+17,1
I think there’s a lot of truth to it in terms of how Christians should act and treat everyone in Gods image ,303,6.00632E+17,0
But I don’t think that Donald trumps agenda is anti christ ,303,6.00632E+17,0
"I’m the same way that we should treat everyone with compassion, we too should treat Donald’s trump with compassion and not hold his past against him. ",303,6.00632E+17,0
Yea He’s crazy but God Can use whoever the hell he wants. That is not to say that God supports his delusional behavior but he does support Anyone who defends the Christian faith and allows for the name of God to be exalted in public,303,6.00632E+17,0
￼,303,6.00632E+17,1
It’s still really hard to think of ,303,6.00632E+17,0
"u are more than welcome to disagree. Regardless, it’s already expected than in the future, Christians will be persecuted for their faith. Everyone will be anti Christian. There already are people who hate us bc of our beliefs. ",303,6.00632E+17,0
I think it’s important to note that the video is saying his policies are the opposite of Christ’s teachings. Video isn’t saying his the anti-Christ character from revelation ,303,6.00633E+17,1
"Liked “u are more than welcome to disagree. Regardless, it’s already expected than in the future, Christians will be persecuted for their faith. Everyone will be anti Christian. There already are people who hate us bc of our beliefs. ”",303,6.00633E+17,1
Yea that’s why I said his agenda ,303,6.00635E+17,0
anti christ agenda ,303,6.00635E+17,0
and what I meant with the last part is that our future is going to inevitably become more  anti christ ,303,6.00635E+17,0
Regardless we are screwed ,303,6.00635E+17,0
"Alright, just making sure. ",303,6.00635E+17,1
"Lol no, stop being a pessimist ",303,6.00635E+17,1
It’s in the Bible ,303,6.00635E+17,0
it’s predicted to happen ,303,6.00635E+17,0
End times are nothing positive ,303,6.00635E+17,0
hopefully I’m not around during that time ,303,6.00635E+17,0

Read the last 2 paragraphs if you don’t wanna read the whole thing,303,6.00642E+17,1
The thing that bothered me is u said to treat him with compassion. How much compassion can we have for a man who keeps acting immoral.  When do we reach a limit,303,6.00642E+17,1
"He’s only playing into Christian values to get their vote. He’s not about that action, his daily actions prove that. ",303,6.00642E+17,1

IM JUST SAYING,303,6.00643E+17,1
Not necessarily ,303,6.00643E+17,0
Like look what we r doing Rn lol,303,6.00643E+17,1
He divided ppl ,303,6.00643E+17,1
Divides*,303,6.00643E+17,1
You’re the one setting the divide,303,6.00643E+17,0
Check out his twitter ,303,6.00643E+17,1
And you’ll see what I mean ,303,6.00643E+17,1
I just think we think differently ,303,6.00643E+17,0
And that’s all ,303,6.00643E+17,0
"I’m not, Yamz",303,6.00643E+17,1
We’re more alike than you think ,303,6.00643E+17,1
You just have to follow why he says and does ,303,6.00643E+17,1
And maybe you might agree with me,303,6.00643E+17,1
Dude I know what he says and does ,303,6.00643E+17,0
I’m not oblivious ,303,6.00643E+17,0
U know about how he locks immigrant kids in cages?,303,6.00643E+17,1
he thinks he’s the “king of Israel”,303,6.00643E+17,0
How he goes into teenager dress rooms ,303,6.00643E+17,1
And he says racist things all the time ,303,6.00643E+17,0
How he brags about grabbing women ,303,6.00643E+17,1
he talks shit about everyone ,303,6.00643E+17,0
Very Christ like huh,303,6.00643E+17,1
And not himself ,303,6.00643E+17,0
He’s not a Christian ,303,6.00643E+17,0
So he can literally rape someone but Christians will still support him bc he will fight for two issues ,303,6.00643E+17,1
Idgi,303,6.00643E+17,1
No,303,6.00643E+17,0
Will be interestifn thought to see what people say if that were to happen.  ,303,6.00643E+17,0
Then how can we say God is using him to support faith when his actions do the opposite ,303,6.00643E+17,1
Ok so would you say that accepting a president that legalized abortions is a moral ,303,6.00643E+17,0
*Moral ,303,6.00643E+17,0
Are those actions supporting of faith? ,303,6.00643E+17,0
Presidents can legalize abortions ,303,6.00643E+17,1
The Supreme Court does that,303,6.00643E+17,1
They did that,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Ok say a president that supports that ,303,6.00643E+17,0
"Yes. Bc it’s not a black and white issue. Sometimes abortions are necessary, like when maybe a women can die if she were to give birth, or if she got raped ",303,6.00643E+17,1
It’s a very gray area ,303,6.00643E+17,1
I’m talking about the abortions that are not due to a woman at risk ,303,6.00643E+17,0
those are considered natural abortions ,303,6.00643E+17,0
And trump has had his women get many abortions btw,303,6.00643E+17,1
Show me where you heard that,303,6.00643E+17,0
Okay,303,6.00643E+17,1
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-marueen-dowd-interview-abortion-past-partners,303,6.00643E+17,1
He’s a liar dude. He’s only using Christians for their vote ,303,6.00643E+17,1
And their support ,303,6.00643E+17,1
And isn’t there an abortion in the Bible?,303,6.00643E+17,1
In numbers?,303,6.00643E+17,1
Where a a guy made a girl drink some poison to see if the baby was his or not and if it wasn’t the baby would die,303,6.00643E+17,1
He dodges the question ,303,6.00643E+17,0
U don’t think an honest person would say no?,303,6.00643E+17,1
Come on Yamz lol,303,6.00643E+17,1
I don’t doubt he did,303,6.00643E+17,0
So how can Christians support him if they’re so terrible again abortion?,303,6.00643E+17,1
Against*,303,6.00643E+17,1
Against those are things from his past but what do we now about that now ,303,6.00643E+17,0
He’s the same dude lol,303,6.00643E+17,1
And I don’t know of any abortions in the Bible. I’ll have to read that,303,6.00643E+17,0
I’ll send u the scripture rn,303,6.00644E+17,1
Numbers 5:11-31,303,6.00644E+17,1
Tell me what u think of that,303,6.00644E+17,1
say he’s the same but what if it wasn’t him being president. You think other presidents right now would allow Christian to practice their faith,303,6.00644E+17,0
Probably not. ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Yes Yamz ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Any president would ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Because it’s our first amendment ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Freedom of speech ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Freedom of religion ,303,6.00644E+17,1
And it’s our right to practice whatever faith we want ,303,6.00644E+17,1
That’s why so many ppl left Europe in the 17the century ,303,6.00644E+17,1
No one is out here trying to destroy Christians ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Just cause there’s a decline in the church doesn’t mean ppl want Christianity gone ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Laughed at “Just cause there’s a decline in the church doesn’t mean ppl want Christianity gone ”,303,6.00644E+17,0
Hahah there is a decline in the church because everyone’s being swayed ,303,6.00644E+17,0
There will only be few because Christians don’t have a faith that is favorable to people at this time ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Hence the gay rights and abortion movements ,303,6.00644E+17,0
And all the things that come with whatever is waiting for us I’m the future ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Those are simple basic rights for human beings ,303,6.00644E+17,1
I am all about that,303,6.00644E+17,0
Ur not,303,6.00644E+17,1
But my faith informs me that the practice of such things is not what the God asks of us ,303,6.00644E+17,0
That’s all,303,6.00644E+17,0
Fair enough,303,6.00644E+17,1
I can’t do anything to stop it ,303,6.00644E+17,0
We already talked about this lol,303,6.00644E+17,1
It’s gonna happen ,303,6.00644E+17,0
And that’s how it’s going to be ,303,6.00644E+17,0
It’s already happening ,303,6.00644E+17,1
I know ,303,6.00644E+17,0
"Jesus didn’t force us to follow him, he didn’t get the angels to come down and save him from the cross ",303,6.00644E+17,1
So we can’t force ppl to follow beliefs ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Jesus didn’t force us too,303,6.00644E+17,1
We should force ppl either ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Shouldn’t*,303,6.00644E+17,1
Yea but as a Christian I can’t remain silent of my beliefs ,303,6.00644E+17,0
That’s exactly right ,303,6.00644E+17,1
U have a right to ur speech ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Just like u have a right to practice ur faith ,303,6.00644E+17,1
I will respect people and will want to learn about where they come from with things but me not saying anything bc I don’t wanna hurt them is not helpful either ,303,6.00644E+17,0
No one is asking u to stay quiet ,303,6.00644E+17,1
but they are,303,6.00644E+17,0
It’s already happening ,303,6.00644E+17,0
No,303,6.00644E+17,1
People are unhappy at the sound of someone who is “anti gay”,303,6.00644E+17,0
Even if the message is delivered in a kind and compassionate way ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Not all of them,303,6.00644E+17,1
Well the majority is ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Lol stop it,303,6.00644E+17,1
That’s just how it’s going to be ,303,6.00644E+17,0
That’s not true ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Dude have you had conversations with all the gay people you know about challenging their beliefs ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Or have you just stayed silent ,303,6.00644E+17,0
not said anything ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Wait what,303,6.00644E+17,1
Nvm ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Challenging their beliefs about what,303,6.00644E+17,1
About being gay ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Like why they’re gay?,303,6.00644E+17,1
Yea,303,6.00644E+17,0
Yeah I talk to them about it,303,6.00644E+17,1
Majority of them say they just knew at a young age ,303,6.00644E+17,1
They were attracted to their own sex for whatever reason ,303,6.00644E+17,1
And don’t start with that they were abused stuff ,303,6.00644E+17,1
🙄,303,6.00644E+17,0
😂,303,6.00644E+17,1
It just happens ,303,6.00644E+17,1
We talked about this already ,303,6.00644E+17,1
It’s a mixture of a lot of things ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Not just thing ,303,6.00644E+17,1
One thing*,303,6.00644E+17,1
Dude I know ,303,6.00644E+17,0
"Look Yamz, we obviously disagree on some things but I want u to know I’m still ur #1 fan lol okay",303,6.00644E+17,1
ur the one bringing all of this up ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Bc u keep saying things about trump when you don’t have all the facts ,303,6.00644E+17,1
I wasn’t tryna have a convo about this but here we are ,303,6.00644E+17,0
I want u to be informed :-(,303,6.00644E+17,1
What am I saying about trump ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Not just accept whatever u hear ,303,6.00644E+17,1
You asked me my opinion and I said that ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Fair enough,303,6.00644E+17,1
"I am informed thank you, but I’m also informed of other things and In that area I already know you disagree ",303,6.00644E+17,0
Okay okay,303,6.00644E+17,1
So that’s just how it is ,303,6.00644E+17,0
Don’t get angry :-(,303,6.00644E+17,1
I am not angry,303,6.00644E+17,0
:/,303,6.00644E+17,1
I am just reminding you,303,6.00644E+17,0
That you asked me ,303,6.00644E+17,0
And I reaponded ,303,6.00644E+17,0
And you weren’t happy with that ,303,6.00644E+17,0
"Okay, I got it",303,6.00644E+17,1
Bc ir rubbed your the wrong way ,303,6.00644E+17,0
I wasn’t happy ,303,6.00644E+17,1
Hahahaha,303,6.00644E+17,0

Taxing billionaires ,303,6.00645E+17,1
Reducing military spending ,303,6.00645E+17,1
"We spend so much on military, more than the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th combined ",303,6.00645E+17,1
The money is def there,303,6.00645E+17,1
It’s just that America thinks healthcare should be made to create profits ,303,6.00645E+17,1
Disliked “It’s just that America thinks healthcare should be made to create profits ”,303,6.00645E+17,0
Which Bernie disagrees with ,303,6.00645E+17,1
"Bernie things healthcare is a right, u should have the right to be healthy ",303,6.00645E+17,1
He also wants to make medicine cheaper ,303,6.00645E+17,1
Like insulin ,303,,

"Very true. Bc I don’t think about it. 

Jk so here’s the chisme since you won’t stop being nosy",303,6.00765E+17,0
Basically I told my parents I drink. ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Bc Im tryna be honest with them ,303,6.00765E+17,0
But it backfired ,303,6.00765E+17,0
￼,303,6.00765E+17,1
Ooooooo,303,6.00765E+17,1
They didn’t know that u drink???,303,6.00765E+17,1
no they didn’t ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Don’t u drink like sometimes tho,303,6.00765E+17,1
And there’s a reason I never told the ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Them ,303,6.00765E+17,0
U never told them?,303,6.00765E+17,1
Why,303,6.00765E+17,1
Liked “Don’t u drink like sometimes tho”,303,6.00765E+17,0
Bc it would backfire ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Lol wow,303,6.00765E+17,1
like it did ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Bc they think that having even one sip is a sin,303,6.00765E+17,0
See y can’t u be good like me and not drink lolol jkjk ,303,6.00765E+17,1
Nah they trippin ,303,6.00765E+17,1
Jesus drank ,303,6.00765E+17,1
Laughed at “See y can’t u be good like me and not drink lolol jkjk ”,303,6.00765E+17,0
I bet ur dad was the most upset huh,303,6.00765E+17,1
Yes,303,6.00765E+17,0
Yes and no,303,6.00765E+17,0
My mom was really upset ,303,6.00765E+17,0
They should have more trust in u than that,303,6.00765E+17,1
:-(,303,6.00765E+17,1
Ok so here’s the deal,303,6.00765E+17,0
Let hear it,303,6.00765E+17,1
Or read it I guess ,303,6.00765E+17,1
the night of my graduation I went out with all my Biola friend a to heroes bar and grill ,303,6.00765E+17,0
For grad night basically ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Nice,303,6.00765E+17,1
I don’t like where this is going ,303,6.00765E+17,1
so I had a drink or two right. Like everybody else. ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Just one or two?,303,6.00765E+17,1
Or more,303,6.00765E+17,1
This is a no judgement zone ,303,6.00765E+17,1
I had two drinks ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Okay okay,303,6.00765E+17,1
and a sip from other people’s drinks. I wasn’t drunk ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Lolol okay,303,6.00765E+17,1
So I didn’t tell my mom I was gonna drink clearly ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Bc they don’t know that ,303,6.00765E+17,0
I thought they knew lol,303,6.00765E+17,1
But that night she had an idea that I would drink ,303,6.00765E+17,0
Oooo,303,6.00765E+17,1
What did she do,303,6.00765E+17,1
I didn’t go home that night I slept over with my friends ,303,6.00765E+17,0
If she want to the restaurant to spy on u I’m out ,303,6.00765E+17,1
And so she calls me the next day and leaves me a voicemail and says how she has a bad feeling I was doing something I wasn’t supposed to (aka drink) ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Laughed at “If she want to the restaurant to spy on u I’m out ”,303,6.00766E+17,0
Wow 😂😂😂,303,6.00766E+17,1
And I was like you know what mom ,303,6.00766E+17,0
I did drink ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And I’m ok with that ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Ooooooooooooo,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
You should be,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Ur over 21,303,6.00766E+17,1
I told her how much I had and the occasion ,303,6.00766E+17,0
What she say,303,6.00766E+17,1
She was upset ,303,6.00766E+17,0
:/,303,6.00766E+17,1
Bc the next day I was my graduation party ,303,6.00766E+17,0
You know ,303,6.00766E+17,0
The thing you didn’t go to ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Ooooooo,303,6.00766E+17,1
LOL STOP IT,303,6.00766E+17,1
DONT MAKE ME FEEL BAD,303,6.00766E+17,1
And she felt like my action was a dishonor to God ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Gods son had alcohol ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Bc in my graduation party we are ultimately giving glory to God but me drinking the night before basically ruined it ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Oh come on,303,6.00766E+17,1
and again let me remind you that my parents and everyone at that party think the same ,303,6.00766E+17,0
🙄🙄🙄,303,6.00766E+17,1
Well good thing I didn’t go then huh,303,6.00766E+17,1
Lol jkjk,303,6.00766E+17,1
So the whole time they seemed uneasy ,303,6.00766E+17,0
They all knew??,303,6.00766E+17,1
Or just ur parents ,303,6.00766E+17,1
And disappointed that their daughter drank the day before ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Wowooow ,303,6.00766E+17,1
And not only that but they were mad that I ditched them for that ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Is how they put it ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Okay,303,6.00766E+17,1
First of all,303,6.00766E+17,1
I don’t even know where to start ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Bc they wanted to go out with me that night but I had already told them weeks in advance that wouldn’t be able to hang out that day ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Smh,303,6.00766E+17,1
ok so weeks later ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Which was Monday,303,6.00766E+17,0
they bring it up ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Like yesterday?,303,6.00766E+17,1
Laughed at “Like yesterday?”,303,6.00766E+17,0
yes ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Why’d they bring it up,303,6.00766E+17,1
Bc I haven’t been going to church yet ,303,6.00766E+17,0
So all these things are piling up ,303,6.00766E+17,0
"Uh oh, I know where this is going ",303,6.00766E+17,1
Somehow all of this is tied to that night I drank ,303,6.00766E+17,0
since then they’ve been seeing me act differently ,303,6.00766E+17,0
They think you’ve been losing ur faith or something ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Laughed at “They think you’ve been losing ur faith or something ”,303,6.00766E+17,0
Yea something like that ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Well we all know that’s not true ,303,6.00766E+17,1
I know ,303,6.00766E+17,0
But again me simply being ok with drinking tells them otherwise ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Did u tell them that Jesus has wine ,303,6.00766E+17,1
What’s their response to that ,303,6.00766E+17,1
I’ve already made my points on what I think about drinking and they bring up the verses in the Bible that oppose drinking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Jesus literally had wine on the cross ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Emphasized “Jesus literally had wine on the cross ”,303,6.00766E+17,0
Okay well first of all they’re being unreasonable ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Yea he literally made wine for people at a wedding.But those verses they cite are about people who get drunk ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Exactly ,303,6.00766E+17,1
The Bible verses they cite are warnings against drunkardness ,303,6.00766E+17,0
U only drink a little ,303,6.00766E+17,1
And not every freaking day ,303,6.00766E+17,1
I know ,303,6.00766E+17,0
So my point to them was exactly that ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And on special occasions ,303,6.00766E+17,1
I wanted them to know that it’s possible to drink responsibly ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And not be an alcoholic ,303,6.00766E+17,0
It is,303,6.00766E+17,1
Like they fear,303,6.00766E+17,0
2 drinks won’t make someone an alcoholic ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Yea,303,6.00766E+17,0
And it doesn’t make me drunk.,303,6.00766E+17,0
Now of course I have been drunk before ,303,6.00766E+17,0
I think u told me 😂,303,6.00766E+17,1
And now that I’m ok with because now I know my limited ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Limits*,303,6.00766E+17,0
Yes,303,6.00766E+17,1
And I don’t like being drunk and throwing up and all that stuff ,303,6.00766E+17,0
It’s a buzz kill,303,6.00766E+17,0
Nah that’s gross ,303,6.00766E+17,1
So I don’t do that ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And unattractive ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Anyway ,303,6.00766E+17,0
The don’t have to know that,303,6.00766E+17,0
😂😂😂,303,6.00766E+17,1
Yeah don’t tell them that before they kill u lol,303,6.00766E+17,1
It’s been years that I have reasoned on both sides of the arguments regarding drinking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And I’ve made my peace with it ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And I told my parents that I respect their belief ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And I see and understand the risks ,303,6.00766E+17,0
That’s good ,303,6.00766E+17,1
And where they are coming from ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Here comes the but,303,6.00766E+17,1
but I am not less of a Christian ,303,6.00766E+17,0
For being ok with social drinking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
That’s exactly right ,303,6.00766E+17,1
So that backfired ,303,6.00766E+17,0
I know that and I’m a newbie Christian ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Hahaha,303,6.00766E+17,0
:-(,303,6.00766E+17,1
I’m sorry Yamz :/,303,6.00766E+17,1
I told them that my Christian friends drink ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Ooooo what they say to that,303,6.00766E+17,1
And they never pressure me to drink ,303,6.00766E+17,0
I simply observed them ,303,6.00766E+17,0
😂,303,6.00766E+17,1
And asked them why they are ok with drinking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And from then I analyzed their responses ,303,6.00766E+17,0
What they say ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Well nothing out of the ordinary other than it is not a sin ,303,6.00766E+17,0
To drink ,303,6.00766E+17,0
it’s a problem when you’re overtaken by it ,303,6.00766E+17,0
As anything else ,303,6.00766E+17,0
So they really think drinking is a sin?? Ur parents I mean ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Emphasized “it’s a problem when you’re overtaken by it ”,303,6.00766E+17,1
and they cite the verses where Jesus made wine and blah blah ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Exactly ,303,6.00766E+17,1
Yea they do ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Wwwooowwww,303,6.00766E+17,1
Because there argument is that God liberated them from their past linden,303,6.00766E+17,0
Life ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Which includes drinking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And smoking ,303,6.00766E+17,0
All that stuff ,303,6.00766E+17,0
so I understand ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Oh dang they use to smoke too??,303,6.00766E+17,1
All that party lifestyle is attached to their old selves ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Yeah it’s understandable but that doesn’t mean ur gonna be like that ,303,6.00766E+17,1
yea ,303,6.00766E+17,0
U know better and more responsible than these other lil Downey girls I know lol,303,6.00766E+17,1
So I told them it’s because Hispanic cultures look at alcohol to sled medicate in a sense ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Laughed at “U know better and more responsible than these other lil Downey girls I know lol”,303,6.00766E+17,0
self ,303,6.00766E+17,0
And it’s a problem ,303,6.00766E+17,0
Yeah das not good ,303,6.00766E+17,1
And yes most Hispanics have an alcohol problem and I’m aware of it ,303,6.00767E+17,0
So what are you gonna do now?,303,6.00767E+17,1
A lot of ethnicities do :/,303,6.00767E+17,1
Yea literally anyone can have this problem ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Have you told them straight up like just cause u may have suffered from something doesn’t mean I will ,303,6.00767E+17,1
So I don’t know what I’m gonna do ,303,6.00767E+17,0
I just told them ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Or yelled ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Exactly that,303,6.00767E+17,1
LOL,303,6.00767E+17,1
That it’s not fair ,303,6.00767E+17,0
It really isn’t ,303,6.00767E+17,1
That they would believe that me drinking has ruined my testimony as a christin ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Oh come on lol,303,6.00767E+17,1
That’s manipulation ,303,6.00767E+17,1
So this topic is nonnegotiable ,303,6.00767E+17,0
We know that isn’t true lol jeez,303,6.00767E+17,1
Wow,303,6.00767E+17,1
But it’s ok,303,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
They don’t get it ,303,6.00767E+17,0
It’s not okay actually ,303,6.00767E+17,1
They don’t :/,303,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
it’s not ok ,303,6.00767E+17,0
But it’s ok ,303,6.00767E+17,0
😂😂,303,6.00767E+17,1
Bc Im ok with itb,303,6.00767E+17,0
And I know what I believe in this ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Well when u wanna drink just don’t tell them anymore lol,303,6.00767E+17,1
Laughed at “Well when u wanna drink just don’t tell them anymore lol”,303,6.00767E+17,0
Yea I guess ,303,6.00767E+17,0
"Ur responsible enough, just keep it on the down low",303,6.00767E+17,1
I just rather they know the truth you know ,303,6.00767E+17,0
U shouldn’t have to feel guilty over some drinks lol,303,6.00767E+17,1
TRUE,303,6.00767E+17,1
But unfortunately this is how it’s gon be ,303,6.00767E+17,0
But when they’re gonna question ur faith for it,303,6.00767E+17,1
That’s not right ,303,6.00767E+17,1
Yea well they already do ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Smh,303,6.00767E+17,1
They’ll warm up ,303,6.00767E+17,0
They always do ,303,6.00767E+17,0
sometimes ,303,6.00767E+17,0
:-(,303,6.00767E+17,1
Lol wow,303,6.00767E+17,1
That ain’t right ,303,6.00767E+17,1
it’s simply a difference in culture and how we are raised ,303,6.00767E+17,0
Yup,303,6.00767E+17,1
Like Tara ,303,6.00767E+17,0

They’re beliefs r so set in stone ,303,6.00767E+17,1
Cannot be shaken ,303,6.00767E+17,0

So I just read ur message sin insta. So why did that family get 25 million ?,303,6.00904E+17,0
bc he molested the child,303,6.00904E+17,0
?,303,6.00904E+17,0
and what makes you believe he didn’t molest children ,303,6.00904E+17,0
ok you know maybe “molest” is too harsh for you. Let’s say he did inappropriate things with children,303,6.00904E+17,0
"regardless of consent or not, that my friend is still considered sexual abuse",303,6.00904E+17,0
U and ur creepy shows LOL,303,6.00908E+17,1

Jackson and the family settled ,303,6.00908E+17,1
Jackson was never convicted ,303,6.00908E+17,1
Laying in a bed with someone is sexual abuse now???,303,6.00908E+17,1
"I have 3 reasons why I think
Jackson is innocent ",303,6.00908E+17,1
I’ll tell u later lol,303,6.00908E+17,1
Maybe you’ll see that this was extortion at its tiniest ,303,6.00908E+17,1
I’ll just tell u rn,303,6.00908E+17,1
1. The police told the child to describe michaels penis bc MJ has vitiligo. The police then made Jackson strip and show his stuff. The boy’s description didn’t match MJ’s thing,303,6.00908E+17,1
"2. After the settlement was reached, there was still a criminal investigation going on. It’s weird 2 investigations for one thing. The family stopped participating in the 2nd investigation after the settlement ",303,6.00908E+17,1
3. Two grand juries in the 2nd investigation found no evidence to even begin a trial ,303,6.00908E+17,1
Also 4. The boy’s biological father was jealous that MJ was spending too much time with the step dad and the boy. ,303,6.00908E+17,1
The biological dad was the one who wanted the $,303,6.00908E+17,1
There’s a lot of facts that need to be discussed before just coming up with a conclusion ,303,6.00909E+17,1
He wasn’t the only boy he “slept” with tho ,303,6.00909E+17,0
there were multiple ,303,6.00909E+17,0

a lot of women have come forth years later about people sexually assaulting them ,303,6.00909E+17,0
Yeah that’s true ,303,6.00909E+17,1
But because it wasn’t proven ,303,6.00909E+17,0

And I’m not just saying this cause I like his music and don’t wanna feel guilty lol,303,6.00909E+17,1
I actually truly believe this was some extortion plot ,303,6.00909E+17,1

Das a lié,303,6.0111E+17,1
Lie,303,6.0111E+17,1
but I am genuinely concerned and interested in peoples stories ,303,6.0111E+17,0
especially documentaries ,303,6.0111E+17,0
Fair enough ,303,6.0111E+17,1
and the killer shows,303,6.0111E+17,0
There’s always something that is wrong ,303,6.0111E+17,0
The football one ur gonna love ,303,6.0111E+17,1
Mentally wrong ,303,6.0111E+17,1
Yea I think I will,303,6.0111E+17,0
I’ve been wanting to,303,6.0111E+17,0
"And yes there’s always something wrong, mentally spiritually etc",303,6.0111E+17,0
Yeah ,303,6.0111E+17,1
And it’s a lot of biopsychosocial factors ,303,6.0111E+17,0
But at the end of the day I still majority of the ppl are good ppl. You can’t let that 1% of bad ppl ruin the whole perspective of the collective ,303,6.0111E+17,1
I don’t even know what that word is lol,303,6.0111E+17,1
I can’t even pronounce that,303,6.01111E+17,1
So that’s my area of interest how a dysfunction in these areas can cause someone to become mentally disturbed and. Angry and evil ,303,6.01111E+17,0
Oh dang ,303,6.01111E+17,1
I don’t think it ruins my perspective ,303,6.01111E+17,0
Ur definitely gonna love the football show then ,303,6.01111E+17,1

"Ball = X
Bat = Y
So X + Y = 1.10
But we know that the bat cost $1 than the ball so we can rewrite:
Ball = X
Bat = X +1
It’s X plus 1 bc ball (X) plus $1
So then X + X + 1 = 1.10
2X+1=1.10
2X=.10
X=.05
Ball = .05
Bat = .05 + 1 = 1.05
1.05+.05=1.10",303,6.0129E+17,1

https://youtu.be/Tqe5JS14z3o,303,6.01583E+17,1
Yea well abortion is legal up to the last trimester ,303,6.01583E+17,0
A baby has a heart beat by the 4 week of pregancy ,303,6.01583E+17,0
Pregnancy,303,6.01583E+17,0
Well it depends on the state ,303,6.01583E+17,1
But I’m pretty sure last trimester abortions are the least common ones ,303,6.01583E+17,1
So,303,6.01583E+17,0
I’m just saying ur using the extreme to prove ur point 😂,303,6.01583E+17,1
Life and heart beat is already present at the 4th week,303,6.01583E+17,0
No,303,6.01583E+17,0
Yeah that probably true ,303,6.01583E+17,1
Even in the mid trimesters its still the same procedures,303,6.01583E+17,0
Emphasized “Life and heart beat is already present at the 4th week”,303,6.01583E+17,1
They suction babies out ,303,6.01583E+17,0
And not to mention that there are risk associated with getting these abortions anytime after 12 weeks too,303,6.01583E+17,0

You make it sound like all mothers die ,303,6.01583E+17,1
And all can’t have babies anymore ,303,6.01583E+17,1
I think my main focus is the abortion itself,303,6.01583E+17,0
The act of getting rid of the baby,303,6.01583E+17,0
I don’t think that’s the main focus tbh,303,6.01583E+17,1
And its associated risk anyway ,303,6.01583E+17,0

Found it in my parents room,303,6.01583E+17,0
Ooooooo,303,6.01583E+17,1
So why did you wanna show this video ,303,6.01583E+17,0
Cause I remembered it from an Econ class a long time ago ,303,6.01583E+17,1
And I thought it was interesting ,303,6.01583E+17,1
And I was feeling controversial ,303,6.01583E+17,1

"And also btw, I hope u don’t think like grace that just bc I have certain views, that I learned that from my “liberal school” ",303,6.01583E+17,1
Public schools can’t persuade u in which way to think. They just give all the facts and let u decide ,303,6.01584E+17,1
I never said that,303,6.01585E+17,0
I didn’t say that u said it :/,303,6.01585E+17,1
All I’m saying btw is that I hope I lady never has to be in that situation. Preventing an unwanted pregnancy should be the way to go. But if things happen I think it should be up to the lady to decide. Government shouldn’t tell her what to do. Das it 😂,303,6.01589E+17,1
"Emphasized “And also btw, I hope u don’t think like grace that just bc I have certain views, that I learned that from my “liberal school” ”",303,6.01589E+17,0
My b never got to respond . My friend needed a ride. But anyway i think u do have more of a “liberal” perspective ,303,6.01589E+17,0
But i dont think you learned that in school i think its just implied ,303,6.01589E+17,0
"Yeah, I guess 😂",303,6.0159E+17,1
All i am saying is abortion is simply morally wrong ,303,6.0159E+17,0
Would you agree with that?,303,6.0159E+17,0
I don’t disagree with that ,303,6.01592E+17,1
It depends on the situation too,303,6.01592E+17,1
Nothing about this is simple ,303,6.01592E+17,1
"What if the mom can die, would it be morally wrong or right to abort?",303,6.01592E+17,1
Well in the process of labor if complocations arise i would say that is not an abortion and no one is intentionally killing the baby and that is not an abortion ,303,6.01592E+17,0
I’m talking about like a weak mom who finds out shes pregnant and knows that if she continues her pregnancy she might have a change of dying ,303,6.01592E+17,1
I’m not talking about being in labor ,303,6.01592E+17,1
I was talking about labor,303,6.01592E+17,0
😂,303,6.01592E+17,1
Because that happens all the time ,303,6.01592E+17,0
"Okay so, can u explain that again ",303,6.01592E+17,1
I get the complications arise part. What’s the part after that ,303,6.01592E+17,1
The only time an “abortion” is ok is in the moment the complications arise during labor which then the dr has no choice but to save the mothers life because labor is too risky ,303,6.01592E+17,0
"Okay, yes",303,6.01592E+17,1
And that is ok bc its not premeditated,303,6.01592E+17,0
Mmhhmm,303,6.01592E+17,1
But u are asking if its ok to abort a child before going through labor ,303,6.01592E+17,0
Which my answer is no it is not ok,303,6.01592E+17,0
Yeah I know!!,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
That is an intentional and premeditated plan to abort an innocent human being ,303,6.01592E+17,0
I understand that,303,6.01592E+17,1
*Kill,303,6.01592E+17,0
So whats ur poiny,303,6.01592E+17,0
Point,303,6.01592E+17,0
😂😂,303,6.01592E+17,1
U were the one who asked me a question 😂,303,6.01592E+17,1
Let me answer it,303,6.01592E+17,1
You asked me the question ,303,6.01592E+17,0
And you said i know,303,6.01592E+17,0
so then ,303,6.01592E+17,0
?,303,6.01592E+17,0
"So I guess ur question is, is it morally wrong to abort a child when a mom just simply doesn’t want the child ",303,6.01593E+17,1
No is it morally wrong to abort. Period.,303,6.01593E+17,0
So yes,303,6.01593E+17,0
That was ur question that u asked me!!!,303,6.01593E+17,1
I’m trying to answer here,303,6.01593E+17,1
😂😂,303,6.01593E+17,1
Settle down over there jeez ,303,6.01593E+17,1
Ok ,303,6.01593E+17,0
I understand that life forms a conception. I get that. But the question if it’s morally wrong or right doesn’t apply to me bc I can’t have abortions. That question is best suited for the ladies who are in that difficult situation ,303,6.01593E+17,1
Ok no,303,6.01593E+17,0
"Personally, if I got a girl pregnant I would def raise the child ",303,6.01593E+17,1
In general ,303,6.01593E+17,0
It does apply,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
To you ,303,6.01593E+17,0
How,303,6.01593E+17,1
Bc ur a human too ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Yes,303,6.01593E+17,1
My mum thinks I’m an animal but yeah,303,6.01593E+17,1
And intentionally killing any innocent child is morally wrong,303,6.01593E+17,0
Which is abortion ,303,6.01593E+17,0
And murdering anyone ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Born or unborn,303,6.01593E+17,0
Well that’s the thing. Not everyone agrees that a fetus is a full person ,303,6.01593E+17,1
That’s the issue here,303,6.01593E+17,1
Well it is ,303,6.01593E+17,0
it is a person,303,6.01593E+17,0
They have thought ,303,6.01593E+17,0
They feel and recognize mothers voice,303,6.01593E+17,0
Obviously they are maturing ,303,6.01593E+17,0
"Maybe, idk enough about all the specifics ",303,6.01593E+17,1
In their development ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Ok maybe its time to research that ,303,6.01593E+17,0
😂😂,303,6.01593E+17,1
So you have “the facts”,303,6.01593E+17,0
HAHAHAHA,303,6.01593E+17,1
Stop it,303,6.01593E+17,1
Putting words in my mouth ,303,6.01593E+17,1
U want the facts no ,303,6.01593E+17,0
I never said I have all the facts about abortion ,303,6.01593E+17,1
Thats what you say,303,6.01593E+17,0
😂😂,303,6.01593E+17,1
Yes,303,6.01593E+17,1
Well im saying you have not considered those facts i wanna shed light on,303,6.01593E+17,0
I have considered both sides of the argument ,303,6.01593E+17,1
To also further emphasize why my stance is the way it is,303,6.01593E+17,0
That is a real full person or that’s it’s not ,303,6.01593E+17,1
This is leas about a well constructed argument and more about the facts,303,6.01593E+17,0
About the reality of the situation,303,6.01593E+17,0
Regardless of what the situation is abortion is simplu ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Morally wrong ,303,6.01593E+17,0
"Listen, some people might think it’s a full person some don’t. All I’m saying is if I got a girl pregnant I would raise the kid",303,6.01593E+17,1
Thats just how it is,303,6.01593E+17,0
Not everyone agrees with u tho,303,6.01593E+17,1
Yea bc everyone appeals to their feelings and their desires and will literally change the definition of what a person is to get what they want. ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Obviously not everyone agrees with me,303,6.01593E+17,0
and they wont ,303,6.01593E+17,0
"I mean maybe, idk",303,6.01593E+17,1
But scientifically speaking,303,6.01593E+17,0
Some people might actually feel that way for certain ,303,6.01593E+17,1
Life begins at conception and getting an abortion due to unwanted pregnancies and or whatever is an intentional act of murder. Simply put,303,6.01593E+17,0
morally wrong ,303,6.01593E+17,0
I understand ur point ,303,6.01593E+17,1
Too,303,6.01593E+17,0
"Another thing that bothers me is that the same ppl who care so much about abortions, don’t care what happens to the kid after ",303,6.01593E+17,1
Immigrant locked up in cages? Who cares right ,303,6.01593E+17,1
"And, and, the You say it’s my body my choice they are also wrong because babies are their own separate person and apart from the woman’s body",303,6.01593E+17,0
Kid doesn’t have enough to eat?? Who cares ,303,6.01593E+17,1
But the woman has to endure all that. She’s the life support. If she doesn’t wanna be the life support why should we punish her into doing something she doesn’t wanna do?,303,6.01593E+17,1
Well thats people right. The people that agree abortion is ok are the ones that fight for those who get locked up huh,303,6.01593E+17,0
So look,303,6.01593E+17,0
Everyone needa jesus ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Lol wow,303,6.01593E+17,1
Yeah I guess ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
"To end all this, idk if it’s morally wrong. I see both sides of the issue ",303,6.01593E+17,1
I can understand both sides ,303,6.01593E+17,1
If its morally wrong,303,6.01593E+17,0
Then is is wrong,303,6.01593E+17,0
And there is no acceptable time ,303,6.01593E+17,0
Correct ,303,6.01593E+17,1
where it would change ,303,6.01594E+17,0
so u saying you understand both sides,303,6.01594E+17,0
U are saying ?,303,6.01594E+17,0
Yes,303,6.01594E+17,1
U are saying there is a time where an abortion is acceptable ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Yes,303,6.01594E+17,1
And all of a sudden not morally wrong ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Idk if it’s morally wrong ,303,6.01594E+17,1
I never said yes or no,303,6.01594E+17,1
Its is,303,6.01594E+17,0
That’s your opinion ,303,6.01594E+17,1
I have a different opinion ,303,6.01594E+17,1
well thats just you not wanting to admit ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Thats not an opinion though,303,6.01594E+17,0
🙄🙄,303,6.01594E+17,1
It is morally wrong ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Okay I understand that u think it’s morally wrong ,303,6.01594E+17,1
No i don’t think,303,6.01594E+17,0
It is,303,6.01594E+17,0
and you wanting to beat around the bush on that aint going to change that ,303,6.01594E+17,0
😂😂😂,303,6.01594E+17,1
So ur saying u want me to choose a side ,303,6.01594E+17,1
u not acknowledging it doesn’t justify appropriate times to abort ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Ms. I hate choosing sides ,303,6.01594E+17,1
No ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Bc innately this is simply morally wrong,303,6.01594E+17,0
but by you admitting it it would imply i are picking a side,303,6.01594E+17,0
but u dont wanna admit its morally wrong bc then it proves a point,303,6.01594E+17,0
"One can argue it would be morally wrong to bring in a child when ur not prepared. No money, no housing, no nothin",303,6.01594E+17,1
but its not,303,6.01594E+17,0
Thats not morally wrong,303,6.01594E+17,0
Moral issue would be killing ur child,303,6.01594E+17,0
Beating him ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Abusing him ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Omg 😂,303,6.01594E+17,1
Well I guess we disagree then,303,6.01594E+17,1
"Ima just say it’s fine for ladies to have abortions if they see fit. Obviously, like I said, I would prefer them to avoid unwanted pregnancies but we’re human. Things happen. Abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. Das it",303,6.01594E+17,1
Very rare,303,6.01594E+17,1
Smh,303,6.01594E+17,0
That’s how I honestly feel about this and I’m sorry we don’t agree lol,303,6.01594E+17,1
hahah thats up to you ,303,6.01594E+17,0
But now i see how you approach this ,303,6.01594E+17,0
How do I approach it? 😂,303,6.01594E+17,1
Abortion,303,6.01594E+17,0
Oh you mean what I think about it,303,6.01594E+17,1
Yeah lol now u know,303,6.01594E+17,1
yea and its kinda disappointing ,303,6.01594E+17,0
I’m sorry to have disappointed you :/ but that’s just how I feel lol,303,6.01594E+17,1
"It’s not like I’m out here preaching about abortions, like they’re cool or something cause they’re not cool. Nobody wants abortions ",303,6.01594E+17,1
It’s a difficult thing ,303,6.01594E+17,1
Its not a difficult thing to see,303,6.01594E+17,0
Abortions are morally wrong,303,6.01594E+17,0
"Well, I disagree I guess ",303,6.01594E+17,1
Wow,303,6.01594E+17,0
So ur ok with the idea of intentionally killing a child,303,6.01594E+17,0
In certain situations if the mom thinks it’s the best idea for her then sure. Who am I to tell her what’s best for her?,303,6.01594E+17,1
I’m not God,303,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
but ur acting like you are by determining  my when it is ok to end a babies life ,303,6.01594E+17,0
no ones telling you to go preach it ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Or tell her whats best for her,303,6.01594E+17,0
Obviously people are going to do it ,303,6.01594E+17,0
Yes,303,6.01594E+17,1
Well ok,303,6.01594E+17,0
Lol I’m sorry we disagree. We just have different world views I guess ,303,6.01594E+17,1
i domt think u need to apologize to me ,303,6.01594E+17,0
U seem pretty upset :/,303,6.01594E+17,1

0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
i also don’t think this is about different world views. some moral issues are nonnegotiable ,303,6.01595E+17,0
Especially when it comes to life ,303,6.01595E+17,0
"Born or unborn, disabled, non disabled, black, white, you name it ",303,6.01595E+17,0
Yeah I know you’re disappointed in me,303,6.01595E+17,1
And of course my faith has something to do with it but really its all in the science ,303,6.01595E+17,0
And i think science itself is what reaffirmed my beliefs in this ,303,6.01595E+17,0
"Yeah, I understand where you’re coming from, I get it ",303,6.01595E+17,1
But u said we were dropping this lol so let’s just drop it,303,6.01595E+17,1

u should watch,303,6.06384E+17,0
Let me ruin it for u,303,6.06384E+17,1
IT IS,303,6.06384E+17,1

i dont believe it is ,303,6.06384E+17,0
Y,303,6.06384E+17,1
Well i dont think it is for everyone,303,6.06384E+17,0
Well let me re answer that,303,6.06384E+17,1
Love is blind to a certain extent ,303,6.06384E+17,1
I think people have different extents ,303,6.06384E+17,1
Yea,303,6.06384E+17,0

so u see all of that here,303,6.06384E+17,0
Don’t even have to watch the show ,303,6.06384E+17,1
Also i think there is a difference between love and infatuation,303,6.06384E+17,0
I would agree with that,303,6.06384E+17,1
Yea couples that only know each other for like a month and propose,303,6.06384E+17,0
Thats infatuation,303,6.06384E+17,0
True true ,303,6.06384E+17,1
It works out sometimes tho,303,6.06384E+17,1
Love is a choice that comes through time,303,6.06384E+17,0
Not all the time,303,6.06384E+17,1
Love aint just a feelin,303,6.06384E+17,0
and yes it works ,303,6.06384E+17,0
sometimes,303,6.06384E+17,0
Yeah idk tbh,303,6.06384E+17,1
Then what is love if it’s not a feeling ,303,6.06384E+17,1
Love encompasses the feeling obvi,303,6.06384E+17,0

That’s good,303,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Once they got educated on it through my perspective ,303,6.0749E+17,0
And when did i start feeling like this u asked?,303,6.0749E+17,0
"Nice nice, good job!!",303,6.0749E+17,1
Yes,303,6.0749E+17,1

I think i felt different my while life,303,6.0749E+17,0
:-(,303,6.07491E+17,1
But experienced it in highschool,303,6.07491E+17,0
And then dealt with understanding it ever since highschool,303,6.07491E+17,0
And then coming to terms with it and my faith ,303,6.07491E+17,0
I see I see,303,6.07491E+17,1
And then finally opening up to someone ,303,6.07491E+17,0
That’s good!!!,303,6.07491E+17,1
Which in this case was grace and the girls,303,6.07491E+17,0
Very good,303,6.07491E+17,1
and then being ok with myself,303,6.07491E+17,0
Loved “and then being ok with myself”,303,6.07491E+17,1
And then telling my parents,303,6.07491E+17,0
"That’s the most important part lol, make sure you’re okay!!!",303,6.07491E+17,1
And then yea thats the short version,303,6.07491E+17,0

Yes ,303,6.07491E+17,0
Sorry about that :-(,303,6.07491E+17,1
Especially when u called me a homophobe,303,6.07491E+17,0
:-(,303,6.07491E+17,1
bc u didnt even know,303,6.07491E+17,0

So you consider yourself bi still?,303,6.07491E+17,1
yes,303,6.07491E+17,0
its just how it is,303,6.07491E+17,0
Interesting!!,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Its is me being aware and accepting that i have attractions to both sexes,303,6.07491E+17,0
there is nothing wrong with that,303,6.07491E+17,0
"Well, I know your faith means a lot to you so I will try my hardest in anyway I can, to keep you in the path that your faith says ",303,6.07491E+17,1
Definitely nothing wrong with it,303,6.07491E+17,1

And God loves me the same ,303,6.07491E+17,0
That’s the truth ,303,6.07491E+17,1
"God loves everyone equally, at least from what I’ve read in the Bible 😂",303,6.07491E+17,1
well thats what the words says and that is the truth,303,6.07491E+17,0
But unfortunately people suck,303,6.07491E+17,0
Like me,303,6.07491E+17,1

Oh,303,6.07491E+17,1
Haha,303,6.07491E+17,1
And make people think that gay people cannot be loved,303,6.07491E+17,0
but that is just them,303,6.07491E+17,0
That’s stupid ,303,6.07491E+17,1
Being “homophobic”,303,6.07491E+17,0
bc it is just that,303,6.07491E+17,0
being prejudiced and biased,303,6.07491E+17,0
Yes,303,6.07491E+17,1
And never getting to know them or hear them out,303,6.07491E+17,0
It’s sad,303,6.07491E+17,1
That’s also called being a bigot ,303,6.07491E+17,1
Nor extending the love of Christ to them ,303,6.07491E+17,0
Bigotry ,303,6.07491E+17,1
"Yeah, you’re right ",303,6.07491E+17,1
I’m so sorry for all of this :/,303,6.07491E+17,1

Which makes u the same,303,6.07491E+17,0
"But still lol, I gotta be more careful ",303,6.07491E+17,1
The same? :/,303,6.07491E+17,1
Yea,303,6.07491E+17,0
What do u mean?,303,6.07491E+17,1
I meant that you were basically doing the same ,303,6.07491E+17,0
the same thing that people do when they judge a gay person,303,6.07491E+17,0
Without knowing their story,303,6.07491E+17,0
Oh :/,303,6.07491E+17,1
Not that u are judging gays,303,6.07491E+17,0
But judging a person for their belief,303,6.07491E+17,0
I champion for them :/,303,6.07491E+17,1
without knowing their story first,303,6.07491E+17,0
Yeah I get what you’re saying,303,6.07491E+17,1
I apologize for that,303,6.07491E+17,1
I was being stupid ,303,6.07491E+17,1

I will not make dumb comments before knowing people ,303,6.07491E+17,1
Truly knowing ppl ,303,6.07491E+17,1
haha we all need to work on that. But i promise you are ok with me ,303,6.07491E+17,0
Can I say something?,303,6.07491E+17,1
Sure,303,6.07491E+17,0
I think it’s kinda funny how I was questioning this whole Bible sexuality thing and out of all people it was you,303,6.07491E+17,1
That’s great coincidence lol,303,6.07491E+17,1
"Idk, thought that was interesting!!!",303,6.07491E+17,1
Haha,303,6.07491E+17,0
It is interesting,303,6.07491E+17,0
And it is me ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
I always wondered why u were so adamant about that topic,303,6.07491E+17,0
I questioned whether you were gay too,303,6.07491E+17,0
And I’m very glad we’re okay!! You’re probably still going to be upset with me for a while but we’re be fine I hope ,303,6.07491E+17,1
Are you?,303,6.07491E+17,0
Lol no,303,6.07491E+17,1
Haha,303,6.07491E+17,0
alright well nothing wrong with it ,303,6.07491E+17,0
I just really care about people treated equally ,303,6.07491E+17,1
"And trust me yamili, if I was gay I would’ve told you by now 😂😂",303,6.07491E+17,1
"Laughed at “And trust me yamili, if I was gay I would’ve told you by now 😂😂”",303,6.07491E+17,0

What does it mean,303,6.07763E+17,1
"My guess is u want me to focus on this verse
 :22 “If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely[e] but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.",303,6.07763E+17,0
Yes,303,6.07763E+17,1
If a pregnant women in the old testament was injured by men fighting and gives birth prematurely there are two possible outcomes,303,6.07763E+17,0
1. If the pregnant woman gives birth prematurely (due to injury) but there is no injury (to the woman or child) then the one responsible has to pay up. The price is decided by the husband this pregnant woman,303,6.07763E+17,0
2. pregnant woman gives birth prematurely and there IS injury (to either the women or child) then this is a serious injury that requires one to pay up the price of a life,303,6.07763E+17,0
which would mean that if either the baby dies or the mother dies the person who caused it would have to die Or give up one of their children or something ,303,6.07763E+17,0
Ah I see,303,6.07763E+17,1
Now this was in the old testament. The old testament was wild and there was laws. ,303,6.07763E+17,0
Thanks for explaining that for me!!,303,6.07763E+17,1
Yeah I remember that lol,303,6.07763E+17,1
The whole eye for an eye and life for a life was demolished when christ came to eartg,303,6.07763E+17,0

so you are saying he became christian just bc he wanted to please his wife,303,6.0782E+17,0
HAHAHA,303,6.0782E+17,0
No,303,6.0782E+17,1
Omg ,303,6.0782E+17,1
He had an incentive ,303,6.0782E+17,1
Wasn’t the whole part ,303,6.0782E+17,1
But played a small role,303,6.0782E+17,1
Hahaah,303,6.0782E+17,0
I do not even knowwww what to say to you ,303,6.0782E+17,0
🙄🙄,303,6.0782E+17,1

Nothing just rolling my eyes right now like big time ,303,6.07821E+17,0
Omg,303,6.07821E+17,1

I am about to study,303,6.07821E+17,0
If i pick up ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Lolol okay okay,303,6.07821E+17,1
Not even gonna get to studying,303,6.07821E+17,0
3 hours go by LOL,303,6.07821E+17,1
Okay look,303,6.07821E+17,1
How about after,303,6.07821E+17,0
I’ll just say this ,303,6.07821E+17,1
I’ll rewatch the movie ,303,6.07821E+17,1
And try to read the Bible with an open mind,303,6.07821E+17,1
OKAY,303,6.07821E+17,1
U go study know before u give me a headache ,303,6.07821E+17,1
And we can talk after if u have time ,303,6.07821E+17,1
Yamz ,303,6.07834E+17,1
Can I ask u question that will make u get more canas?,303,6.07834E+17,1
sure,303,6.07836E+17,0
Romans 13,303,6.07836E+17,1
5-Jan,303,6.07836E+17,1
What does that mean to you???,303,6.07836E+17,1
Specifically verses that 1-2,303,6.07836E+17,1
Lol hold up let me read,303,6.0784E+17,0
I was taking communion with my fam ,303,6.0784E+17,0
We were streaming the online church service ,303,6.0784E+17,0
So i think the verses are talking about how we as christians must respect the authorities put in place like trump or whatever,303,6.07841E+17,0
i think that submission here does not mean obedience,303,6.07841E+17,0
but respect ,303,6.07841E+17,0
Because at the end of the Day God places these people in authority wether good or evil to serve his purpose ,303,6.07841E+17,0
"Lolol nice nice, fair enough!! ",303,6.07843E+17,1
Cause the highest authority in the US (Supreme Court) made abortion legal in 1973. This is God’s plan??,303,6.07843E+17,1
￼,303,6.07843E+17,1
Gods plan like drake lolol,303,6.07843E+17,1
um no ,303,6.07843E+17,0
Oh,303,6.07843E+17,1
Well den,303,6.07843E+17,1
He is not like whispering into ppls ear like hey make abortion legal its my plan,303,6.07843E+17,0
But the verse!!!,303,6.07843E+17,1
Thats not what the verse is saying. Gods plan is not for there to be abortion.,303,6.07843E+17,0
Rather he knows that there will be good and bad rulers or governers or authorities (you name it),303,6.07844E+17,0
But he says that the ppl he put in place or authority are part of his plan ,303,6.07844E+17,1
Ok,303,6.07844E+17,0
Omg 😂,303,6.07844E+17,1
Let me explain,303,6.07844E+17,0
Ok,303,6.07844E+17,1
God as someone all knowing of the present pst and future knows who will be in power or in authority. So when it says he places people in authority he is not placing them and therefore causing their decisions,303,6.07844E+17,0
Rather he permits good and bad people to be in place of power,303,6.07844E+17,0
"And whatever these people with free will decide to do, whether good or evil",303,6.07844E+17,0
Will not get in the way of Gods ultimate plan ,303,6.07844E+17,0
So God doesn’t have any input on who the authority will be? ,303,6.07844E+17,1
I am saying he doesnt govern their decisions,303,6.07844E+17,0
People have free will,303,6.07844E+17,0
"But God still has a plan, right?",303,6.07844E+17,1
Yes ,303,6.07844E+17,0
So abortion becoming legal in 1973 had nothing to do with God??,303,6.07844E+17,1
No those things are expected to happen. The word says that in the end times people will betray one another and hate one another and people will stop practicing love ,303,6.07844E+17,0
And push Gods name out if the picture ,303,6.07844E+17,0
Oh dang,303,6.07844E+17,1
So things that are contrary to the word of God are expected to play out in the earth,303,6.07844E+17,0
Thats is why it is not a shocker that abortion was legalized,303,6.07844E+17,0
So does that mean we’re near the end times? :/,303,6.07844E+17,1
Or that homosexuality is legalized ,303,6.07844E+17,0
Or that people will betray their loved ones,303,6.07844E+17,0
That there will be epidemics/pandemics,303,6.07844E+17,0
Hunger,303,6.07844E+17,0
Suffering ,303,6.07844E+17,0
Earthquakes,303,6.07844E+17,0
Natural disasters,303,6.07844E+17,0
Guau,303,6.07844E+17,1
That doesn’t sound fun,303,6.07844E+17,1
And still not the end of the world,303,6.07844E+17,0
But reminds us,303,6.07844E+17,0
We are closer to the end times,303,6.07844E+17,0
So we’re close???,303,6.07845E+17,1
And also support what was already prophesied in His word,303,6.07845E+17,0
Well no,303,6.07845E+17,0
Not fun at all,303,6.07845E+17,0
Dang we went from abortion to end of times ,303,6.07845E+17,1
What a transition lolol,303,6.07845E+17,1
Hahah ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Okay that was all I wanted to ask,303,6.07845E+17,1
Just what u thought about that scripture ,303,6.07845E+17,1
So why do you ask?,303,6.07845E+17,0
What are ur questions,303,6.07845E+17,0
Just curious to what you thought!!!,303,6.07845E+17,1
I was confused on the 1st verse ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Bc u are thinking...?,303,6.07845E+17,0
That it means,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Where it says God established the authority ,303,6.07845E+17,1
"So I was like well if Gods established the authority that made this hot topic issue legal, then wth is going on here ",303,6.07845E+17,1
But then I guess God just let’s ppl do what they want ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Hhahahaha,303,6.07845E+17,0
And that the end times are near too I guess ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Well its not so much that he just lets people do what they want,303,6.07845E+17,0
Its bc we have free will,303,6.07845E+17,0
Yeah this is confusing my dude ,303,6.07845E+17,1
"Of course when you become a believer you as a person of free will, choose to follow his will and act in obedience to him ",303,6.07845E+17,0
Not gonna lie 😂,303,6.07845E+17,1
Or you become a vessel for destruction ,303,6.07845E+17,0
But he still has a plan for all of us?,303,6.07845E+17,1
Which is then a vessel used by the enemy ,303,6.07845E+17,0
So rn I’m a vessel of destruction??,303,6.07845E+17,1
Hahaha ,303,6.07845E+17,0
I am not saying you are,303,6.07845E+17,0
but the people in authority if not submitted to God ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Then are submitted to the enemy,303,6.07845E+17,0
Who is the “prince of the earth”,303,6.07845E+17,0
Causing spiritual warfare,303,6.07845E+17,0
Wait,303,6.07845E+17,1
Trying to ruin Gods plan for salvation for everyone ,303,6.07845E+17,0
So if people in authority aren’t Christina they’re serving the enemy??,303,6.07845E+17,1
Christian*,303,6.07845E+17,1
So it’s a if you ain’t with us you’re against us type thing??,303,6.07845E+17,1
Not all the time ,303,6.07845E+17,0
We would have to judge that based on their actions ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Although it gets tricky,303,6.07845E+17,0
Abraham Lincoln didn’t affiliate with any religions ,303,6.07845E+17,1
I think he was pretty good by freeing slaves lol idk,303,6.07845E+17,1
But I guess he was serving the enemy on that one ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Bc there are times God uses non christian people to help others ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Lolol jkjk,303,6.07845E+17,1
Yea ,303,6.07845E+17,0
No,303,6.07845E+17,0
He wasn’t serving the enemy ,303,6.07845E+17,0
So when’s it’s good,303,6.07845E+17,1
It was God,303,6.07845E+17,1
But when it was bad,303,6.07845E+17,1
It was the enemy,303,6.07845E+17,1
Emphasized “Bc there are times God uses non christian people to help others ”,303,6.07845E+17,1
Hmm ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Kinda but yea,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Omg 😂😂😂,303,6.07845E+17,1
This is confusing lol,303,6.07845E+17,1
Can there be a person who was submitted to God but does bad ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Or is that just part of God’s plan ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Ok someone who submitts to God is not gonna approve of something horrendous right ,303,6.07845E+17,0
I don’t think I agree with that one ,303,6.07845E+17,1
People in the 1700s and 1800s who were submitted to God uses the Bible as a form to justify they’re slavery bc the Bible is indifferent about slavery ,303,6.07845E+17,1
And that was a horrible use of the word,303,6.07845E+17,0
Well the word doesn’t really say much about slavery ,303,6.07845E+17,1
It just says to submit ,303,6.07845E+17,1
As if it’s okay ,303,6.07845E+17,1
Old testament,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
And ,303,6.07845E+17,0
New one doesn’t say that?,303,6.07845E+17,1
Slavery was different in that tome ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Bc they were not mistreated ,303,6.07845E+17,0
Omg 😂,303,6.07846E+17,1
Hold up,303,6.07846E+17,1
Abraham’s servant had to literally sleep with him ,303,6.07846E+17,1
That’s not mistreating???,303,6.07846E+17,1
Forcing someone to have sex,303,6.07846E+17,1
Hahahaha,303,6.07846E+17,0
ITS NOT FUNNY,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Mistreated as in being beat up,303,6.07846E+17,0
But those again were old testament times. The law was the law,303,6.07846E+17,0
The rules were they had to do what their owners told them to do,303,6.07846E+17,0
And that was it ,303,6.07846E+17,0
And God came to rid of that,303,6.07846E+17,0
Law,303,6.07846E+17,0
After Christ died we were to follow his commandments ,303,6.07846E+17,0
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2012%3A47-48&version=NIV,303,6.07846E+17,1
It’s in the New Testament too isn’t it??,303,6.07846E+17,1
Y would God be so indifferent about slavery?? I don’t understand ,303,6.07846E+17,1
You need to read the context of the verse ,303,6.07846E+17,0
To understand what he was saying,303,6.07846E+17,0
You cannot just pick one verse with the word you search and bring it out of context,303,6.07846E+17,0
In that verse jesus was referring to idk whoever he was talking to,303,6.07846E+17,0
I think the jewish law in that time still supported that “slavery” type of thing ,303,6.07846E+17,0
And if the servant did not do what the master asked they were going to receive a beating,303,6.07846E+17,0
Ok so he was making an analogy with what things will be like for believers and unbelievers alike  ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Those believers who knew to Do Gods will and did not do it on this earth will receive a worse beating in hell,303,6.07846E+17,0
Same for non believers ,303,6.07846E+17,0
But theres is a “lighter” beating ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Which is a lighter punishment ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Ah i see ,303,6.07846E+17,1
The believers are held more accountable because they knew what to do ,303,6.07846E+17,0
This in itself has way more context ,303,6.07846E+17,0
I could’ve sworn I saw some scripture in the New Testament that was indifferent about slavery but I forgot where it is :/,303,6.07846E+17,1
And its a lot to unpack,303,6.07846E+17,0
Yeah I understand the Luke 12 part ,303,6.07846E+17,1
I remember it,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
So the slavery thing here was a parable ,303,6.07846E+17,0
For his audience ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Who were probably jews,303,6.07846E+17,0
Yeah I know,303,6.07846E+17,1
And he gave that example so they could understand ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Ok,303,6.07846E+17,0
Cool,303,6.07846E+17,0
Well search for the verse you think conveys indifference about slavery ,303,6.07846E+17,0
And i will read it ,303,6.07846E+17,0
Okay okay,303,6.07846E+17,1
I appreciate that lolol,303,6.07846E+17,1
Ephesians 6,303,6.07846E+17,1
5,303,6.07846E+17,1
I think it was that one ,303,6.07846E+17,1
Colossians 3 22 also,303,6.07846E+17,1
Timothy 6 1,303,6.07847E+17,1
Titus 2 9,303,6.07847E+17,1
Ephesians 6 :5 paul is telling servants who are believers to do their service with respect and a glad heart just like we as christians serve the Lord,303,6.07847E+17,0
But paul in general did not support slavery,303,6.07847E+17,0
Eehhhhh,303,6.07847E+17,1
How do you know??,303,6.07847E+17,1
Does it say somewhere in the Bible??,303,6.07847E+17,1
Paul sought freedom for slaves,303,6.07847E+17,0
Yea,303,6.07847E+17,0
Oh,303,6.07847E+17,1
There is this one time where he ia talking to philemon ,303,6.07847E+17,0
Philemon had a slave ,303,6.07847E+17,0
And the slave ran away,303,6.07847E+17,0
Didn’t he bring him back or something ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Paul was telling philemon to no longer see him as a slave ,303,6.07847E+17,0
But as a brother in christ ,303,6.07847E+17,0
Ima read it hold up,303,6.07847E+17,1
I remember this ,303,6.07847E+17,1
If you read Ephesians 6:5-9,303,6.07847E+17,0
He gives instruction for both the slaves and their masters on how to act,303,6.07847E+17,0
Yes,303,6.07847E+17,1
And states that ultimately the masters and the servants are no better than each othet ,303,6.07847E+17,0
"Btw on Philemon he sends the slave back lol, if he was fighting for freedom of slaves wouldn’t he have just kept him and made him free?",303,6.07847E+17,1
That they both have responsibilities to treat each other with respect and love,303,6.07847E+17,0
Yes,303,6.07847E+17,1
But I guess the whole point of this is,303,6.07847E+17,1
Why not just say,303,6.07847E+17,1
Slavery is bad ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Pls stop,303,6.07847E+17,1
Why keep saying oh just be nice to each other ,303,6.07847E+17,1
And keep on slaving ,303,6.07847E+17,1
But be nice pls,303,6.07847E+17,1
Idgi,303,6.07847E+17,1
Ok the slavery then was not like the african slavery in america  ,303,6.07847E+17,0
Still slavery ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Slavery is slavery ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Bc it wasnt just black people who were slaves in the bible ,303,6.07847E+17,0
I know,303,6.07847E+17,1
And every 7th year slaves were freed,303,6.07847E+17,0
Idk about that one,303,6.07847E+17,1
I don’t remember that ,303,6.07847E+17,1
It was more of a socioeconomic deal,303,6.07847E+17,0
Social status,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
i mean ,303,6.07847E+17,0
That doesn’t make the other 6 years okay tho,303,6.07847E+17,1
Why can’t God be more direct ,303,6.07847E+17,1
What i am saying is that they were not bonded for life,303,6.07847E+17,0
And tell Paul that slavery is bad ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Write that down ,303,6.07847E+17,1
Explicitly ,303,6.07847E+17,1
At sometime they were free ,303,6.07847E+17,0
And even then they had a choice in deciding to stay,303,6.07847E+17,0
Still slaves tho :/,303,6.07847E+17,1
To Paul never advocated for slavery,303,6.07847E+17,0
It’s kind of like me with abortion,303,6.07847E+17,0
I do not support abortion but regardless of people’s decisions on that I am going to do my best to treat those people would love and respect,303,6.07848E+17,0
Is abortion OK no it’s not,303,6.07848E+17,0
Will people get abortions yes they will,303,6.07848E+17,0
"Am I going to miss treat those people who decided to get abortions, no",303,6.07848E+17,0
Haha,303,6.07848E+17,1
Yeah I guess ,303,,

But you get what I’m saying tho,303,6.07848E+17,1
I get what you’re saying,303,6.07848E+17,0
My whole point is why God couldn’t be more direct ,303,6.07848E+17,1
Just like you get what I am saying,303,6.07848E+17,0
And just simply say stop spacing ,303,6.07848E+17,1

Feelings,303,6.09142E+17,0
Well first of all I was not happy I was lied to,303,6.09142E+17,1
Then I was like dang I gotta prepare myself to talk to multiple ppl ,303,6.09142E+17,1
And then that was it,303,6.09142E+17,1
Ok so you do not like talking to people,303,6.09142E+17,0
Thats the problem,303,6.09142E+17,0

I guess I just like to know what to expect ,303,6.09142E+17,1

Bc i may seem outgoing ,303,6.09142E+17,0
Like it’s draining ,303,6.09142E+17,1

When you cough ,303,6.09962E+17,0
And i am talking about being out in the open,303,6.09962E+17,0
Yes,303,6.09962E+17,1
Like if this is in a building,303,6.09962E+17,0
And people cough/sneeze,303,6.09962E+17,0
It stays in that general area,303,6.09962E+17,0
and probably rotates in there,303,6.09962E+17,0
Yes,303,6.09962E+17,1
But in the open it gets carried away anyway ,303,6.09962E+17,0
But not out in the open?,303,6.09962E+17,1
Exactly,303,6.09962E+17,1
Could get carried away to u,303,6.09962E+17,1
Wind isn’t doing us favors here,303,6.09962E+17,1
I understand ur frustrated but it’ll be over soon :/ hang in there,303,6.09962E+17,1
Carries it away and disappears,303,6.09962E+17,0
It’s gonna be fine,303,6.09962E+17,1
Hahaha ,303,6.09962E+17,0
Well that’s not what happened at the beaches in Florida ,303,6.09962E+17,1
They saw dramatic increase on infections ,303,6.09962E+17,1
Yea there was already a rise im coronavirus case before the beach,303,6.09962E+17,0
Wasnt because of the beach,303,6.09962E+17,0
Well it definitely helped it tho,303,6.09962E+17,1
"Yamz, it’ll be fine",303,6.09962E+17,1
Just be patient lol,303,6.09962E+17,1
You can still get ur sun elsewhere ,303,6.09962E+17,1
I think the social distancing was good at first,303,6.09962E+17,0
But now its not,303,6.09962E+17,0
I am saying this in general,303,6.09962E+17,0
For general public,303,6.09962E+17,0
It was good at first because we weren’t really sure what coronavirus was how it spread and who it infects And who dies from it,303,6.09962E+17,0
So social distancing helps decrease the spread,303,6.09962E+17,0
"But now we know what it is and really it’s similar to the flu, people are still dying from the flu, and it is still the older people dying from it",303,6.09962E+17,0
"Now right now, people remaining inside for this long is gonna do greater risk in the long run because their immune systems are weakening. ",303,6.09962E+17,0
🙄🙄🙄,303,6.09964E+17,1
Well look,303,6.09964E+17,1

They’re the ones who recommend this so it’s best we listen to them,303,6.09964E+17,1
hahaha ,303,6.09965E+17,0
I got this from the experts. Two ER doctors that actually did research and compared their data from coronavirus cases at their clinic,303,6.09965E+17,0

Well what makes you think that,303,6.10304E+17,0

Correct,303,6.10304E+17,1
To you,303,6.10304E+17,0

To you,303,6.10305E+17,0
You think that ,303,6.10305E+17,0

there are some stuff that is not taken literally,303,6.10305E+17,0
Like God is my rock,303,6.10305E+17,1
God isn’t a rock ,303,6.10305E+17,1

Or maybe he is? Idk lol,303,6.10305E+17,1
Such as parables,303,6.10305E+17,0

￼,303,6.10311E+17,1
HAHA,303,6.10311E+17,1
i think that video you seny makes perfect sense because in that context the question is how does the big band theory fit in the creation story. If people are tryna fit the word into science then obviously its way easier to understand the creation story as a truth story and no a literal one because it wont discredit the scientific theories.,303,6.10318E+17,0
Yes,303,6.10319E+17,1
Bible is how to get to heaven ,303,6.10319E+17,1
Not how the heavens are made,303,6.10319E+17,1
but also tells the story of creation ,303,6.10319E+17,0
"Figuratively, yes",303,6.10319E+17,1
Bc it does help understand how the heavens were made,303,6.10319E+17,0
And our origin,303,6.10319E+17,0
Not figurativel,303,6.10319E+17,0
Its true,303,6.10319E+17,0
Are you gonna then say that jesus being born of a virgin woman is also figurative ,303,6.10319E+17,0
? ,303,6.10319E+17,0
Bc up until now there is no scientific evidence for that phenomenon ever happening ,303,6.10319E+17,0
so maybe jesus wasnt real,303,6.10319E+17,0
Oh and if adam and eve weren’t real people ,303,6.10319E+17,0
Then there wouldn’t have been an original sin,303,6.10319E+17,0
And then jesus would have never have to come to save us,303,6.10319E+17,0
"It doesn’t matter to me where Jesus came from, I still love him",303,6.10319E+17,1
of course that doesnt change,303,6.10319E+17,0
But in order to understand him more,303,6.10319E+17,0
Then you understand his scriptures and where we come from,303,6.10319E+17,0
"And on the original sin, we all do stupid things today so that’s enough sin",303,6.10319E+17,1
Jesus does for sins of the past present and future ,303,6.10319E+17,1
Died*,303,6.10319E+17,1
yes and you understand that bc  of the knowledge of how sin entered the world,303,6.10319E+17,0
So it does matter,303,6.10319E+17,0
How this came to be,303,6.10319E+17,0
Its part of your understanding for our need of salavation,303,6.10319E+17,0
And that happened through real humans,303,6.10319E+17,0
I agree,303,6.10319E+17,1
By the way adam and eve werent the only ones alive during their time,303,6.10319E+17,0
There were more people ,303,6.10319E+17,0
Its complex,303,6.10319E+17,0
if you pay close attention to the chapter there are literally two separate human creations,303,6.10319E+17,0

I’m interested to see what she says lolol,303,6.10494E+17,1
Same ,303,6.10494E+17,0
What you said doesnt make sense,303,6.10494E+17,0
Ommmgggg,303,6.10494E+17,1
How,303,6.10494E+17,1
I’m telling her science explained how we came to be ,303,6.10494E+17,1
Doesn’t mean God isn’t in the picture ,303,6.10494E+17,1
How are you sure science knows how me came to be ,303,6.10494E+17,0
Do tell me ,303,6.10494E+17,0
how did we come to be ,303,6.10494E+17,0
Evolution ,303,6.10494E+17,1
"It doesn’t know 100% exactly l, we won’t ever know that",303,6.10494E+17,1
But it does a good job,303,6.10494E+17,1
Well enough that there isn’t any other explanations that other scientist have come up with to compete with evolution ,303,6.10494E+17,1
So genesis is all a made up story,303,6.10494E+17,0
But its conveying a truth that didnt happen ,303,6.10494E+17,0
?,303,6.10494E+17,0
Why would somone make up a story that didnt happen in that much detail ,303,6.10494E+17,0
https://youtu.be/Q-aGAX27SIo,303,6.10494E+17,1
"If you really wanna see it, watch it",303,6.10494E+17,1
And then if you believe in evolution how jesus creating us fit in there,303,6.10494E+17,0
And it’s a story that’s easy to understand how we came about (I’m taking about Adam and Eve),303,6.10494E+17,1
But science has progressed so far we don’t need that story to know how we came about ,303,6.10494E+17,1
It is easy to understand but you do not believe it actually happened?,303,6.10494E+17,0
Oh really ,303,6.10495E+17,0
We do not need this story to know how we came about,303,6.10495E+17,0
So we do jot need jesus?,303,6.10495E+17,0
What does jesus have to do with genesis?,303,6.10495E+17,1
That’s not what I’m saying at all lol,303,6.10495E+17,1
Thats what science does. Pull people away from believing in Gods word,303,6.10495E+17,0
No,303,6.10495E+17,1
Because humans think they know everything slowly but surely they start pulling away from God’s truth in the Bible and suddenly the stories they don’t really matter since we already know what science says,303,6.10495E+17,0
"It shows us how the world works, how this beautiful place that God made works for us",303,6.10495E+17,1
"Don’t worry this happens a lot, just like the story of the Tower of Babel",303,6.10495E+17,0
It helps us understand ,303,6.10495E+17,1
We don’t know anything ,303,6.10495E+17,1
That’s the whole thing of science ,303,6.10495E+17,1
Figure something out ,303,6.10495E+17,1
And people will challenge you ,303,6.10495E+17,1
But you were saying you know enough to not rely in the creation story in the Bible,303,6.10495E+17,0
Science knows enough*,303,6.10495E+17,0
"In terms of creation, yes ",303,6.10495E+17,1
hahaha,303,6.10495E+17,0
What does jesus have to do with genesis?,303,6.10495E+17,0
You asked me that right,303,6.10495E+17,0
I did,303,6.10495E+17,1

It has to do with a lot,303,6.10495E+17,0
Okay,303,6.10495E+17,1
Like what,303,6.10495E+17,1
In fact everything,303,6.10495E+17,0
The Old Testament and the New Testament are connected,303,6.10495E+17,0
I agree,303,6.10495E+17,1
The why say that things that happened in the Old Testament didt actually happen ,303,6.10495E+17,0
I agree,303,6.10495E+17,1
But believe things in the new testament DID happen,303,6.10495E+17,0
do you understand what I’m saying?,303,6.10495E+17,0
These are just questions I’m asking you,303,6.10495E+17,0

I don’t even know what your question is :-(,303,6.10495E+17,1
But we’ll talk lol,303,6.10495E+17,1
my question was what is it about the stories in old testament that makes you think they should not be taken literally? ,303,6.10495E+17,0
"If you believe in the New Testament and take it literally, why  be the same for the Old Testament? Especially if the New Testament is always making references to the old Testament",303,6.10496E+17,0
sorry i meant why wouldn’t*** it be the same for the Old Testament. ,303,6.10496E+17,0
I think I understand your question ,303,6.105E+17,1
"You’re basically asking, what’s stopping you from thinking the OT is allegorical, and the NT isn’t allegorical ",303,6.105E+17,1
Right?,303,6.105E+17,1
Yes,303,6.10501E+17,0

"“You are only what you were created to be—a human, and it is useless to argue about it. People cannot argue with God about this because he is more powerful than they are, and a long argument will not change that fact.

Who knows what is best for people during their short life on earth? Their life passes like a shadow. No one can tell them what will happen later.”

And sad too :/,303,6.11545E+17,1
yea some ppl are deliberately fooled but there is some importance in trump “poniendo el nombre de Dios en alto” i think what she means with that is that he has not prohibited christians from practicing their faith. ,303,6.11545E+17,0
No president ever has ,303,6.11545E+17,1
That’s the thing,303,6.11545E+17,1
It’s our first amendment ,303,6.11545E+17,1
Nobody can mess with people’s religious beliefs ,303,6.11545E+17,1

It WAS,303,6.11545E+17,0
Emphasis on was.,303,6.11545E+17,0
Still has that foundation lol,303,6.11545E+17,1
Read the first amendment ,303,6.11545E+17,1
Read the constitution ,303,6.11545E+17,1
"Slowly and in years to come, its expected ppl will become cold towards christians",303,6.11545E+17,0
No presidential candidate wants to take away religion ,303,6.11545E+17,1
And christians will be prosecuted,303,6.11545E+17,0
Stop falling for that lol ,303,6.11545E+17,1

Oscar,303,6.11545E+17,0
Its in the bible,303,6.11545E+17,0
its happened already,303,6.11545E+17,0
and it will happen,303,6.11545E+17,0
not now,303,6.11545E+17,0
but soon,303,6.11545E+17,0
"In many other places, Christianity has been gaining more people ",303,6.11545E+17,1
I am “not falling” for it,303,6.11545E+17,0
This is exactly like Educated when the dad says the government is coming to kill them lol,303,6.11545E+17,1
Its not,303,6.11545E+17,0
"In the USA, Christians or any other religious sect will be prosecuted lol",303,6.11545E+17,1
That’s what they want u to think to gain power ,303,6.11545E+17,1
Don’t be falling for that 😂,303,6.11545E+17,1
Regardless ,303,6.11545E+17,0
Christians will be prosecuted for practicing their faith,303,6.11545E+17,0
thats gonna happen. I mean unfortunately christians are already looked as ppl who are intelorant or not accepting bc they do not agree with homosexuality (thats just the first example that comes to mind) hate grows towards christians bc they do not agree with that lifestyle. ,303,6.11546E+17,0
Okay hold up,303,6.11546E+17,1
So in the Bible it says Christians will be prosecuted right?,303,6.11546E+17,1
yea,303,6.11546E+17,0
So that means it’s gonna happen 100%?,303,6.11546E+17,1
yes,303,6.11546E+17,0
Its already happened before,303,6.11546E+17,0

on*,303,6.11546E+17,0
Okay,303,6.11546E+17,1
So here’s my point then,303,6.11546E+17,1
"If christians are gonna get persecuted regardless of what happens, why would they compromise their values and vote in trump? He’s just stalling the persecution? ",303,6.11546E+17,1
Idgi,303,6.11546E+17,1
And I still don’t think Christians or any other religion will be persecuted ,303,6.11546E+17,1
What you think doesnt change what will happen 😂,303,6.11546E+17,0
I get what ur saying tho,303,6.11546E+17,0
"look i dont excuse trumps actions. But at the time of the election, he was running vs clinton. And clinton was sketchy as hell (still is) ",303,6.11546E+17,0
It had to be bw lesser of the evils,303,6.11546E+17,0
How was Clinton sketchy?,303,6.11546E+17,1
And I still feel like this whole thing is just u guys being paranoid just like Tara’s dad’s conspiracy lol. No good decisions are made from fear lol,303,6.11546E+17,1
But it’s whatever lol,303,6.11546E+17,1
hhahaha ok,303,6.11546E+17,0
just because there were a lot of paralles between my life and taras it dont mean its parallel in this situation ,303,6.11547E+17,0
Taras and her family were conpletely secluded from society and even the news,303,6.11547E+17,0
Not to mention that he himself was bipolar and had mental health issues. ,303,6.11547E+17,0
his fear came from his own delusions,303,6.11547E+17,0
"Dude there were a lot of clinton scandals and accusations. One being that she sold access to the us state department, missing emails, security failures, idk lots of stuff",303,6.11547E+17,0
"lol okay, and on Clinton, those conspiracies have already been debunked lol",303,6.11547E+17,1
I don’t wanna talk about this anymore lol it’s just disappointing ,303,6.11547E+17,1
Oooy perdon,303,6.11548E+17,0
Dont get angry,303,6.11548E+17,0

"I come in peace!! But here we are. You and your fam believe that trump is the only person who can allow you to practice your faith (1st amendment). But look what he did to this church. He literally kicked out the priest and everyone inside without even notifying the church that he was coming. All that just to get a picture with an upside down Bible. He didn’t even say a prayer, give a speech, or anything. It was literally just for show. Not to mention the violence that had to happen to clear the way for him to get there. I just wish you guys would understand he’s not really on your team. As a matter of fact, he already wants to take away our first amendment by threatening the military on peaceful anti-racism protests. You may be asking why I care so much. I care so much because if he keeps getting away with small little violations of our basic rights, what do you think will happen to religion once religious people stop liking him? That’s going to be how the thing you and your fam fear most will happen. So please, really look into what this man is doing. He’s not promoting any of Jesus’ teachings. He’s not the person you think he is. ",303,6.12813E+17,1
https://religionnews.com/2020/06/02/ahead-of-trump-bible-photo-op-police-forcibly-expel-priest-from-st-johns-church-near-white-house/,303,6.12813E+17,1
"I read the article. I know whats happening. It deeply saddens me and its discouraging. I know trumps attitude and lack of advocacy towards blck ppl is what single handedly inspires hate towards the black community. I know trump is not the best person, in fact i never believed he was.  But this is not about me or my fam being “trump supporters”. I think you are taking that too literally. We do no condone any of his actions; my parents simply focus on the fact that he supports christians practicing their religion bc they believe that regardless of the person hosting this, wherever the name of the Lord is exalted, he shields them or protects him. However, the truth of matter is, that my reason for faith/religion was never based on a human person alone. So that means i am not going to lose my faith just because of someones horrific actions. Trump isn’t the reason why i am christian (and it shouldn’t be for anyone). So i can stop liking him (i never liked him anyway) and continue being rooted in my faith because i dont place my trust in the brokenness of our imperfect world or leader. Instead, its placed in the knowledge of a sovereign God, that loves and knows our hearts and is hurt by the injustice his creation faces.

Trump is not the best and i can only hope God transforms his heart in his timing. As for me and other fellow christians, Gods already shown us what to do: to seek justice, love mercy, and live humbly before him. thats how i am moving forward with this. My black brothers and sisters need this.",303,6.12819E+17,0
So even if trump exalts the lord without really believing in god and just using it as a power move is enough for you and your parents? Serious question. I’m not trying to start an argument or anything lol. ,303,6.12824E+17,1
He literally doesn’t care about christians or religions at all,303,6.12824E+17,1
He is just using it to get votes ,303,6.12824E+17,1
And it’s so clear,303,6.12824E+17,1
"The thing I don’t understand is how he can be the most non-religious president we have ever had, yet he gets the most support from evangelicals. His actions do not represent Christ. His words might, but his action definitely don’t. The part I don’t understand is why do evangelicals take trumps word at face value? His actions do not represent Christ. And also, every president has let every religion be practiced. Obama didn’t take away your faith, Bush didn’t either ",303,6.12824E+17,1
So I just do not understand ,303,6.12824E+17,1
Please help me understand how the government is taking away your ability to practice your faith in the past,303,6.12824E+17,1
So I can be better informed and try to help in anyway I can,303,6.12824E+17,1
Why r u bringing this up right now,303,6.12824E+17,0
About me practicing my faith,303,6.12824E+17,0
Cause you said it up there ,303,6.12824E+17,1
No i am talking about the government taking away my ability to practice my faith ,303,6.12824E+17,0
“He supports Christian practicing their religion”,303,6.12824E+17,1
Every president has done that lol,303,6.12824E+17,1
"Obama, Bush, Clinton, Bush sr, Reagan ",303,6.12824E+17,1
It seems to be he has fooled evangelicals into thinking he supports them and their faith while at the same time doing the opposite of what the gospels preach lol. I just don’t understand :/,303,6.12824E+17,1
"Its much deeper than that. And why i brought it up up there is because u were asking why i would “support him”. I thought I Made a distinction there for you. I don’t support trumps actions and I don’t like him, he’s a president right now but if there were someone else i would have chosen that person. ",303,6.12824E+17,0
This is me speaking for me,303,6.12824E+17,0
Idk about my parents ,303,6.12824E+17,0
"You don’t support trump actions, only the when he favors Christians? Let me ask you this. Don’t you think it’s odd the he favors Christianity and supports it but he doesn’t even practice it? Doesn’t that tell you something?",303,6.12824E+17,1
"I know none of the presidents took away our faith, but where things are heading in the future, and the hate accumulating and growing towards one another, it is believed that religion will be “taken away”. So some christians see his presidency as this time to prepare for that. So him favoring Christianity alludes to evangelicals for this reason, but it does not excuse what he does.",303,6.12824E+17,0
"And lol dont twist my words. I have never been a Trump supporter, but I have tried respecting him and praying for him to change his heart. Me acknowledging the fact that he supports/favors Christianity does not mean I support the entirety of him.",303,6.12825E+17,0
And I have known he doesnt practice christianity. That does say something. That he is not christian. When I said that he exalts the Lord i simply meant he permits the name of God to be preached. And I said this in light of the fact that there will be lotta changes in the future regarding religion. I know that I butt heads with you in this because you don’t believe that our ability to practice religion will be taken away in the future. But the word says it will and that hatred towards christianity will increase. I also know that religion has been used for misguided agendas.,303,6.12825E+17,0
"Just because it is “believed” doesn’t mean it’s true. Yes, in the USA people are becoming less religious, but that doesn’t mean the non-religious will hate Christians or any other religion. As a matter of fact, our generation is becoming more accepting (like the LGTBQ community). No one will persecute Christins unless Christians or any other religious groups start harming other people. ",303,6.12825E+17,1
"But you do support him favoring your specific religion though. You support at least some part of him just because of his favoritism to your religion, not because of his actions. ",303,6.12825E+17,1
And you’re talking about revelations right?,303,6.12825E+17,1
When you say “hate towards Christianity will increase”,303,6.12825E+17,1
That already happened ,303,6.12825E+17,1
New Christians were being persecuted in the early days of the church ,303,6.12825E+17,1
Now it’s done lol,303,6.12825E+17,1
"Yes, so it will happen again",303,6.12825E+17,0
The only places Christian are being persecuted is in deeply devoted Islam counties,303,6.12825E+17,1
These patterns repeat themseleves,303,6.12825E+17,0
"Well, as of right now, no one in the USA has been advocating for the removal of Christianity lol",303,6.12826E+17,1
That’s un-American,303,6.12826E+17,1
That’s one of the reasons people came to this country before it even was a country in the 1700s,303,6.12826E+17,1
To practice whatever faith or non-faith they wanted ,303,6.12826E+17,1
It’s rooted in us,303,6.12826E+17,1
Christianity will never be taken away and trump will certainly not have anything to do with it 😂,303,6.12826E+17,1
If anything he would be the first to be against Christians if Christians turn against him ,303,6.12826E+17,1
He opposes anyone who isn’t with him,303,6.12826E+17,1
Ok oscar . We just have to wait and see then.,303,6.12826E+17,0
"I’m not trying to start anything, I promise!!!!",303,6.12826E+17,1
"Regardless, idk why we r talking about the religion thing now if this isnt the most pressing issue rn",303,6.12826E+17,0
I get though why u are so angered by him,303,6.12826E+17,0

I’m not angry at him lol,303,6.12826E+17,1
I don’t think I’ve been clear ,303,6.12826E+17,1
I just feel like you are pressing me to pick a side or something and make me feel bad for something i have no control over. ,303,6.12826E+17,0
My main thing that bothers me is that evangelicals support him while trump is the antithesis of the gospel ,303,6.12826E+17,1
No,303,6.12826E+17,1
I know ,303,6.12826E+17,0

I don’t feel like I belong inThat evangelical party,303,6.12826E+17,0

"I’m just confused how people can support him, especially people like you who have the complete opposite morals of I’m ",303,6.12826E+17,1
With their whiteness comes privilege,303,6.12826E+17,0

But not in the second 😂,303,6.13503E+17,1
I saw it on Reddit btw,303,6.13503E+17,1
Both of these things,303,6.13503E+17,0
"Both? Well, only the first one is a video. The 2nd one is an article ",303,6.13503E+17,1

You didn’t even read the article huh,303,6.13504E+17,1
Hahah no bc i already assumed,303,6.13504E+17,0
What its about,303,6.13504E+17,0
I have already gone over that ,303,6.13504E+17,0

Lol dang,303,6.13504E+17,1
The argument is that there is no direct translation of the word homosexual,303,6.13504E+17,0
Well I thought it was a fun read 🤷🏻‍♂️,303,6.13504E+17,1
In greek,303,6.13504E+17,0
Correct!,303,6.13504E+17,1
Instead its a word that says a man that lies with boys,303,6.13504E+17,0
Yes!,303,6.13504E+17,1
Or a man that lies with man,303,6.13504E+17,0
"Though it doesn’t directly translate if you study the word, you know exactly what its refering to",303,6.13504E+17,0
Have you studied the word?,303,6.13504E+17,1
By word do you mean the actual geek word or word as in the Bible lol,303,6.13504E+17,1
And there are cleae depictions when its talking about men that lie w boys and men that lie with men ,303,6.13504E+17,0
Yes at biola,303,6.13504E+17,0
🙄,303,6.13504E+17,1
Whats the difference between the greek word and greek in the bible,303,6.13504E+17,0
?,303,6.13504E+17,0
Isnt it the same thing?,303,6.13504E+17,0
"So you’re telling me, you studied about the origination of the gay word in the Bible from a school that makes you sign an affirmation of faith?????",303,6.13504E+17,1
No bias there at all,303,6.13504E+17,1
Wow ,303,6.13504E+17,0
It’s true!!!,303,6.13504E+17,1
Wouldn’t you say so?,303,6.13504E+17,1
No but as people who are actually christians and study the word as a source given to ha and scrutinize the word so that it reflects the truth if the gospel,303,6.13504E+17,0
Yes we learn it,303,6.13504E+17,0
And I don’t understand your question? Geek word and Greek? It’s the same language ,303,6.13504E+17,1
And can guarantee that we are not tryng to change the word to fit our passions ans desires,303,6.13504E+17,0
How come when people who aren’t Christians or not affiliated (and even some who are) disagree with you and Biola’s assessment ,303,6.13504E+17,1
What it is it is. Ans people who change the meaning without reading the context of the word are unfortunately changing the meaning without considering the context,303,6.13504E+17,0
Well i think you are only focusing on biola as if they are the only ones who believe this,303,6.13504E+17,0
There are plenty of ppl,303,6.13504E+17,0
One thing i can guarantee is that biola never taught me to hate these ppl,303,6.13504E+17,0
And instead invited me to FIRST accept myself,303,6.13504E+17,0
And why would it take them so long to enter “homosexual” in the Bible (1920s or 1930s) when this word in English was already known for hundreds of years ,303,6.13504E+17,1
Nobody said anything about having people 😂,303,6.13504E+17,1
And see this as a reflection of the brokeness of human kind which is not the biggest sin anyway. Idk why ppl like to weigh sins.,303,6.13504E+17,0
And I like that they helped you out lol and helped you accept who you are ,303,6.13504E+17,1
Well why do you think there are didf versions of the bible,303,6.13504E+17,0
And you’re not broken lol wth,303,6.13504E+17,1
I will see the translations fit the culture or language of the ppl reading it,303,6.13504E+17,0
Being gay doesn’t mean your a broken human being 😂,303,6.13504E+17,1
I’m not saying I’m broken,303,6.13504E+17,0
Good ,303,6.13504E+17,1
It’s the nature of it all,303,6.13504E+17,0
Through sin,303,6.13504E+17,0
Scripture was used to justify slavery ,303,6.13504E+17,1
But our time and cultural changes that ,303,6.13504E+17,1
So yes,303,6.13504E+17,1
Scripture does change with culture ,303,6.13504E+17,1
Interpretations change with culture ,303,6.13504E+17,1
We don’t stone kids anymore ,303,6.13504E+17,1
We don’t stone non virgins at their wedding day,303,6.13504E+17,1

All of it,303,6.13505E+17,1
Exactly!!!!!,303,6.13505E+17,1
THATS MY POINT,303,6.13505E+17,1
"When I read that I’m not thinking oh my gosh I’m gonna stone virgins, it’s showing how before Jesus was on earth people had to abide by the law",303,6.13505E+17,0
So why are Christians so prejudiced against gay marriage when that word didn’t even exist 😂,303,6.13505E+17,1
Oohhhhhh so it was allegory?????,303,6.13505E+17,1
😂,303,6.13505E+17,1
Seeing how Grace came to us by Jesus is what makes this whole story altogether makes sense,303,6.13505E+17,0
No see so that’s your problem you don’t even believe in the Bible so why are you arguing about something you don’t even understand,303,6.13505E+17,0
😂😂😂😂,303,6.13505E+17,1
Because first you think Old testament is only an allegory,303,6.13505E+17,0

I hope u get to live out ur life how u want, not how some book tells u too.",303,6.13505E+17,1
The book I’m reading talks about the origin of the abortion issue!! It says that in the 60s and early 70s Protestants ( both Democrats and Republicans) were pro-choice and the Catholics were the ones who were pro-life. It wasn’t until 1979 (6 years after roe v. Wade) that some southern white Christian people wanted to start a movement. They didn’t want to start a movement bc of abortion but because the government wanted to tax their segregated schools! So these white Christian men decided to use abortion as a tool to keep their segregated schools!! They need a movement to gain power. That’s how the pro-life movement originated! No bc of abortions but bc white southern Christian men wanted to keep their schools tax free and segregated bc they thought the Bible wanted them to do that!!! ,303,6.13556E+17,1

Emphasized “You really think it’s okay that god made of all these crazy things he allowed in the OT??”,303,6.1359E+17,0
"No of course i do not think its fair. In my most basic human nature I don’t think it’s fair, but I don’t get to decide How God has dealt with people in the way He thinks they deserve. 

However I do think it’s fair that he gave a law back then just like there are laws now. If one breaks the law there is a consequence. The consequence today is jail/prison time but sadly the consequence in the old testament was death. That is rather harsh but it was not unfair. It would have been unfair if he had never set laws for people to follow in the first place and then just kills them.",303,6.1359E+17,0
"Obviously by you asking if i i think god is fair because of what he did in the OT, you are asking from your human perspective. Obviously from a human perspective Gods  never going to be fair. But you are not a God, you are not sinless, and you are not “just”",303,6.1359E+17,0
God says that all have sinned and have fallen short of Gods glory. And what that deserved was death (like in the OT). BUT God has provided salvation to all as a free gift to anyone that believes in His son Jesus Christ He payed that price in FULL. (NT),303,6.1359E+17,0
"So.... far more than being fair, God is gracious, merciful and just, AND righteous. All of which you inherently fall short of.",303,6.1359E+17,0
"I think if you read your bible in an unbiased way and stop seeing yourself as  the most righteous person out there, You would be able understand Gods character. As the ultimate creator and authoritative God that he is, he can do as he pleases. He is not obligated to treat us in ways WE think are fair. Rather his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and He works all things together for our good.",303,6.1359E+17,0
And haha thank you for wishing that I live out my desires. I desire to listen to the calling God has for me and to do as he pleases. It is also to really scrutinize his words and be honest with my own self about the things i need to let go or change. “Being gay” is not the sin. Whats a sin is the attitude people have that is contrary to what God intents for our lives. ,303,6.1359E+17,0
But everyone has a choice. And even then God is still gracious enough to treat everyone accordingly. He has way more compassion for people that the “Christians” or non christians. ,303,6.1359E+17,0
"I do not agree with your assessment that god is fair, gracious, merciful, and just. We can look at the book of job and see how unfairly he mistreated him. We can see how he had his early tribes take over cities and had them keep the virgin women to themselves, not very gracious, merciful, or just there.  Threatening eternal punishment for acting on natural instincts that god supposedly gave us doesn’t seem gracious, merciful, or just.

I have read the Bible with the most open mind I could! It’s just very barbaric to me. I know your excuse for that will be “well it’s god and he knows more than you”. That’s fine lol. I just hope you can see how barbaric it use to be and I hope that reveals something to you. 

And I’m glad you are truly living out your desire to follow god. Whatever makes you truly happy!!",303,6.13593E+17,1
"Haha again, you are coming at it from your human perspective bc you sit in judge’s seat as if you were the one who knows what is best for all people. So yea, “my excuse” is you are not God and you do not know what is best for people, while your excuse is “this is too barbaric for me”  and thats fine, i just hope you can see that this comes from your lack of understanding in the way that God works.",303,6.13604E+17,0
"I am sorry thats the way you have interpreted the story of job, bc the story isn’t about God being unfair and “mistreating” his people. Its a story about suffering, and how suffering doesn’t necessarily mean you are being punished for sin. It also illustrates how bad things happen to good people and how easily we can lose control. Ultimately, its not about what happens to us but how we respond to the things that happen to us. I think Job at the ends of his suffering confesses his lack of wisdom in understanding the way God works. This was an act of humility. God repays him two-fold, and he grows in wisdom and understanding. This story is packed with a lot of stuff. This is just a synopsis of it.",303,6.13605E+17,0
"And yes, God gave us central human instincts and intended that it stay perfect and holy, the instincts we have today are not what God gave us, they have been misconstrued from sin that entered our world. So no, God is not threatening eternal punishment for something “he supposedly gave us”. What is graceful, merciful and just is that we have an opportunity to gain life, wisdom, and understanding through jesus christ. to be able to surrender our broken lives to a Perfect creator that loves and knows us. That we can bring good news to the poor sick and hungry by exemplifying the love he gave to us.",303,6.13605E+17,0

"When you get the chance, I think you should read this. It offers different perspectives and tackles questions concerning the story of job",303,6.13605E+17,0
"So god can get away with genocide, murder, rape, etc and it’s all okay because he is god and us petty humans don’t know any better?? Well, to me that doesn’t sound like a god worth worshipping. Your “excuses” for god sound like a woman trying to protect her wife-beating husband. The more I read the Bible, the more clear it is that god didn’t make man but that man made god. 

In terms of job from what I remember when I read it, god literally made jobs life miserable in order to prove a point that job will still follow god. What kind of god does that kind of test? Why test if he’s omnipotent?? He already knows the answer.

And I’ll read that document you sent me. I am willing to read anything to help change my mind. I feel like I’m the only one here who doesn’t understand the Bible like u and grace. I am truly reading it with an open mind and that’s how I truly interpret it. ",303,6.13606E+17,1
Hahahaha maybe your focus is too much on humans and not on God. For years men are what have abused of Gods word to carry out things that clearly shouldnt happen. You are focusing on the old testament as something that is relevant today. Which is not. You can just pick and choose stories from there to make a point that is taken out of context,303,6.13606E+17,0
Understanding the whole story and the plan for salvation gives you understanding. ,303,6.13606E+17,0

Emphasized “And thats stupid that man would make God 😂 i wouldnt trust in a God made by men”,303,6.13611E+17,1
"My whole point is this. Why the barbarianism in the OT and NT? If god was omnipotent and knew our current culture today, why would he condone slavery, genocide, rape, misogyny, etc. Why couldn’t he teach those people how to behave. Those stories sound like stories from men of the 1st century, which they are. To me, they are literally screaming man made lol. And then you tell me well it’s a different culture and not relevant to today. Well if it’s a different culture and not relevant, than why are evangelicals so against gay marriage if those things aren’t relevant anymore? It’s like you’re picking and choosing what is relevant and what isn’t.

And I do understand the whole story. OT is a bunch of prophecies that lead up to the NT aka Jesus.

And I have come to find out that baby distress survivals are more common than I thought. Like always, there is a reasonable explanation for everything.",303,6.13612E+17,1
"woah there. Let me rephrase what i meant by that phrase about how they are not relevant today. Of course there is slavery, rape, misogyny, etc in the Old Testament, as there is in the new testament, and sometime even today (even honosexuality if you will). The consequences of those things were dealt with by God accordingly. And for you, the way he dealt with those things was rather “barbaric” and this is the part i am emphasizing as a thing not relevant today. Gods not killing ppl for doing these things bc jesus payed the price. 

And, just because these things are in the bible it doesn’t mean that God was the one who condoned it.",303,6.13626E+17,0
"The central theme that HAS been relevant through ancient time until today is how humans are the ones in need of saving. And people lying stealing killing raping, causing injustice, etc are side effects of a fallen, sinful nature.",303,6.13626E+17,0
"So again, no . I am not picking and choosing things to justify anything or to argue if they are relevant today. If anything, you are picking and choosing these stories that seem barbaric to you to prove whatever point you are wanna justify in your understanding of how you judge and see the world.",303,6.13627E+17,0
"And no, i am so sorry to say you do not understand the OT",303,6.13629E+17,0
Evidenced by your misunderstanding of Job story ,303,6.13629E+17,0
"You should reread the OT. There’s been plenty of times where god has ordered it’s tribe to do horrific things (such as taking over a piece of land and killing innocent people just bc they’re different and letting the tribe keep their virgins.) 

So all of this barbarianism is justified according to you bc it was okay back then & bc god has all authority? And also you’re telling me that this violent punishment doesn’t happen anymore bc Jesus died for people’s sins? Well in the Middle Ages, Christians were literally torturing people bc they thought god had asked them too. If anyone strayed away from the church, they were killed. So don’t tell me jesus saved  people bc he just made it worse for some lol. Why couldn’t god have come down and told them to chill? There were places in Europe where being a non-Christian got you killed. They stole the violence from the Bible and used it on non-Christians.

Look, all I’m trying to say is the Bible is so barbaric because it’s clearly man-made. People do not get their morals from the Bible either lol. They get their morals from other things. All of this doesn’t mean that there are good passages in the Bible, bc there definitely is! I just wish people didn’t use some ancient text to justify some of the violence that people do. And I know you might say that’s not god that’s ppl, but they get their ideas from this “god book”. ",303,6.13629E+17,1

My point is this: to me the Bible is man-made and it’s very clear lol. I understand that you were brought up in a church so you will disagree lol. I just wanted to express my feelings about this I guess ,303,6.13629E+17,1

"If the dad just goes, when the kid is an adult, the adult kid has about 50/50 chance of going ",303,6.13629E+17,1

"So I read the pdf. Maybe I wasn’t clear on what the problem was with the book of job. To begin, I understand the apologetics of job, it’s pretty much a story about trusting god when things go bad bc he has everything under control. My point is this: this whole thing started when satan told god that job wouldn’t believe anymore if satan got the keys to job. Why would an omnipotent, omniscient god let his ego cloud his judgement by letting satan get the best of him? I understand you’re gonna say, well it’s god he can do whatever, we don’t know his plan. I’m just saying even if god was real, this god wouldn’t be someone worth worshipping. Why would anyone worship a god who lets their ego cloud their judgment which in turn causes an innocent person he allegedly created to suffer? That to me is not worth worshipping. That to me is a huge sign that this was man-made and it’s just a story that tells ppl that bad things happen to good people sometime with god added in there. ",303,6.13634E+17,1
Lol,303,6.13634E+17,0
Hahah so you are saying you do not agree with Gods ego? Like if he is a man that he would laugh about his creation and say HA i am God and i am gonna take advantage of everyone bc i am God and i can?,303,6.13634E+17,0
"Again, your interpretation of God is so wrong",303,6.13634E+17,0
No,303,6.13634E+17,1
You are judging him with your humanistic perspective,303,6.13634E+17,0
Lol jeez ,303,6.13634E+17,1

"Its also really hard to accept your interpretation of the bible when 1) you dont even believe in God, after believing and then not believing (wishy washy) and 2) you constantly take biblical text out of context. 3) combining point one and two: you take biblical text out of context and judge whats in there without even knowing who God is bc you dont believe in God",303,6.13635E+17,0

"Yea but it didnt happen anyway, right? 😂",303,6.13635E+17,0
You think it did ,303,6.13635E+17,1
But that’s my point Yamz!!!,303,6.13635E+17,1
No way this happened ,303,6.13635E+17,1
Bc it’s man made ,303,6.13635E+17,1
Just stories ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Hahah ,303,6.13635E+17,0
Its not ,303,6.13635E+17,0
And you should find that thing you keep referring to ,303,6.13635E+17,0
And show me,303,6.13635E+17,0
All right hold up,303,6.13635E+17,1
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+31&version=NLT,303,6.13635E+17,1
24-Jan,303,6.13635E+17,1
God tells Moses to commit genocide ,303,6.13635E+17,1
Look what verse 18 says ,303,6.13635E+17,1
God literally tells Moses to commit genocide and take over a land bc gods tribe has been promise a land lol,303,6.13635E+17,1
There’s many more horrific stories like that too,303,6.13635E+17,1
Which is my point. No way a compassionate and all loving god would write this let alone let his tribe do it. It has to be man made. Doesn’t fit with the description and love and compassion that’s being referenced later on in the NT,303,6.13636E+17,1
Lol ,303,6.13636E+17,0
Do you know who balaam is?,303,6.13636E+17,0
And what he did before that supposed genocide happened?,303,6.13636E+17,0
Tell me,303,6.13636E+17,1
Balaam was an evil or wicked man that made the Israelites commit transgressions or something like that,303,6.13636E+17,0
He like told some other dude that starts with the B (i forget his name) about the way to corrupt israelites,303,6.13636E+17,0
And i think that he told him to entice them with some sexual immoral stuff and foods that were sacrificed to idols,303,6.13636E+17,0
Are you really trying to justify genocide????? Just bc some dude made the Israelites commit transgressions????,303,6.13636E+17,1
"You really think an all loving compassionate god would get this low and have Moses commit genocide, over transgressions?????",303,6.13636E+17,1
"No, i am not justifying a genocide i am offering you a correct interpretation of this story",303,6.13636E+17,0
This just makes my point it has to be man made ,303,6.13636E+17,1
Bc you dont even know whats happening here,303,6.13636E+17,0
No,303,6.13636E+17,0
Hahah,303,6.13636E+17,0
😂😂😂,303,6.13636E+17,1
Wow lol,303,6.13636E+17,1
It goes back to how ppl back them were governed by the law. The price of breaking the law is death,303,6.13636E+17,0
That was the law,303,6.13636E+17,0
Moses fufilled the law ,303,6.13636E+17,0
Which I bring up my point again: would an all loving god have such a consequence ,303,6.13636E+17,1
Only after the law was broken,303,6.13636E+17,0
Which would justify the action there,303,6.13636E+17,0
Wow lol,303,6.13636E+17,1
Now to my human perspective this is obviously crazy,303,6.13636E+17,0
So genocide is acceptable if it’s fulfilling a law,303,6.13636E+17,1
Got it,303,6.13636E+17,1
But this is what happened there,303,6.13636E+17,0
And that is the context there,303,6.13636E+17,0
The genocide was acceptable in the old testament bc it was fufilling the law in the old testament,303,6.13636E+17,0
Lol wow 😂😂😂😂,303,6.13636E+17,1
Okay,303,6.13636E+17,1
But you dont seem to understand what that means for the old testament,303,6.13636E+17,0
Cocnerning the old testament,303,6.13636E+17,0
Emphasis on the old testament,303,6.13636E+17,0
Genocides are acceptable now in the name of god ,303,6.13636E+17,1
In those times,303,6.13636E+17,0
In the old testament,303,6.13636E+17,0
Bc there was the law,303,6.13636E+17,0
as is the them of the Old Testament ,303,6.13636E+17,0
I still can’t believe you’re trying to justify it lol,303,6.13636E+17,1
Should i repeat myself again,303,6.13636E+17,0
And the keeping of the virgins too,303,6.13636E+17,1
WTH is that,303,6.13636E+17,1
The Old Testament ppl had to abide by the law,303,6.13636E+17,0
Set in the old testament ,303,6.13636E+17,0
And if one broke the law ,303,6.13636E+17,0
God doesn’t seem very loving and compassionate in this particular instance ,303,6.13636E+17,1
It was death,303,6.13636E+17,1
I get it,303,6.13636E+17,1
It resulted in death,303,6.13636E+17,0
Hahaha,303,6.13636E+17,0
Very nice of god ,303,6.13636E+17,1
he is a nice Gid,303,6.13636E+17,0
Doesn’t this make u think it was man made?,303,6.13636E+17,1
Like seriously lol,303,6.13636E+17,1
He is a just God,303,6.13636E+17,0
A God that gave the men laws ,303,6.13636E+17,0
So that they would know beforehand ,303,6.13636E+17,0
That they should not commit a transgression,303,6.13636E+17,0
Or the penalty was death,303,6.13636E+17,0
I get it,303,6.13636E+17,1
An unfair unloving God ,303,6.13636E+17,0
Would not give a warning,303,6.13636E+17,0
He would just smite them,303,6.13636E+17,0
😂😂😂😂,303,6.13636E+17,1
Without warning,303,6.13636E+17,0
No you dont get it oscar,303,6.13636E+17,0
Look who is trying to play god now ,303,6.13636E+17,1
You dont,303,6.13637E+17,0
😂😂😂,303,6.13637E+17,1
Omg lol,303,6.13637E+17,1
Na,303,6.13637E+17,0
I am not judging Hod,303,6.13637E+17,0
God,303,6.13637E+17,0
Plus i believe in him,303,6.13637E+17,0
How can I judge something I don’t even think exists ,303,6.13637E+17,1
Lol,303,6.13637E+17,1
I think i know him and understand him a bit more than you maybe ,303,6.13637E+17,0
I’m judging the person who wrote this ,303,6.13637E+17,1
Hahahaha,303,6.13637E+17,0
Na ,303,6.13637E+17,0
Its ok oscar,303,6.13637E+17,0
😂😂,303,6.13637E+17,1
Well you’re the one who justified genocide in the name of god lol,303,6.13637E+17,1
just let it go then,303,6.13637E+17,0
No,303,6.13637E+17,0
There is no justifying the genocide,303,6.13637E+17,0
You just did ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Bc you said it was gods law,303,6.13637E+17,1
I am justifying the GOds decisions in all of this as i am putting myself in the shoes of the Old Testament culture ,303,6.13637E+17,0
Where there is a law set by God,303,6.13637E+17,0
Bc he is a kind God that warns his creation,303,6.13637E+17,0
And the genocide was as a result of a transgression,303,6.13637E+17,0
And kills them when they disobey ,303,6.13637E+17,1
Only after they broke the law,303,6.13637E+17,0
As expected,303,6.13637E+17,0
"Lol well you have fun worshiping that lol, I don’t really wanna be apart of that ",303,6.13637E+17,1
Common to the Old testament,303,6.13637E+17,0
Haha well,303,6.13637E+17,0
Again you don’t understand who God is,303,6.13637E+17,0
So you can keep this perspective and justify your reason for not believing and its ok,303,6.13637E+17,0
But all i am saying is that you are wrong in your interpretation of God,303,6.13637E+17,0
In the first place,303,6.13637E+17,0
My perspective of reasons and logic?,303,6.13637E+17,1
hahaha,303,6.13637E+17,0
Yea,303,6.13637E+17,0

Your reason and logic can only take you so far,303,6.13637E+17,0
I guess,303,6.13637E+17,1
Maybe some ppl weren’t just meant for worshipping supernatural beings lol,303,6.13637E+17,1

"And I watched that video btw, he’s a good apologist I’ve seen him before 😂",303,6.13876E+17,1
So a few things ,303,6.13876E+17,1
"He talks as if humans got our morals from the Christian god. We didn’t. You may disagree bc of the severe indoctrination that u have but there’s been numerous good people who were moral and didn’t even know about the Christian god.

He asks why it’s an “atrocity” and why any “atrocity” is wrong without god. That’s bc we get our values from our current and past cultures. A middle finger here in the US is offensive but go to village in China and they may think you’re pointing up lol. We as a community come together to come up with morals that fits us all. The humans who followed the moralities and rules, reproduced more and survived more. Morals come from humans, not from god. 

The fact that he equated genocide with abortion was disgusting. In this holy book (which he admitted was not to be taken literally but more on that) god has killed numerous innocent people for no other reason but just bc he “wants to”. Abortions happen to low income woman who will literally not survive and makes matters worse for her baby and herself. Two complete different situations and that was disgusting.

He talks about how god has the right to kill people bc he’s god. He literally has a get out of jail free card bc he’s a god. An all loving compassionate god wouldn’t kill for no purpose. Which makes my point that this was man made. It’s obvious this was written by a 1st century bc man and not a loving compassionate god. 

He also talks about how the OT was unique and temporary. That’s not a valid excuse. The Nazi’s said the same thing and look how that turned out. 

That man literally said not to take this literally lol. I hope you at least get to a point that some of these OT stories are allegory. And I’m also thankful that these stories, to me as a nonbeliever, don’t carry any value bc that would really suck worshipping a murderous god",303,6.13877E+17,1

 wow “severe indoctrination” huh haha nice,303,6.13878E+17,0
"Lol I’m sorry but it’s true! You just accept everything you hear from your religious leaders and don’t really question them. It’s not your fault lol, you were just brought up this way. I just hope you question as much as you can and if you’re still at the same spot you were before then that’s cool lol, at least you honesty questioned it",303,6.13878E+17,1
I’m not trying to be mean lol but I just have to tell you how I see it,303,6.13878E+17,1
As a friend ,303,6.13878E+17,1
"You literally missed important points in the vid. May be bc u were already critiquing the vid before you could just listen to it, but i get it bc you still don’t understand the context of the Old Testament as a whole. 

He literally says the God doesn’t just kill people. He is not an arbitrary God. Before he carries such “atrocities” there is the law that was set for the ppl in the Old Testament (We already went over this a couple of times). His justice is manifested in that sense, when there is a transgression of the law, he carries out just actions in accordance to the law. 

In the vid he gave that example about the cannanites being wiped out after years ans years that God was patient with them, providing ways in which they could turn from their evil ways (aka burning their own children as sacrifice to evil God).

So yes, a loving compassionate merciful and just God wouldn’t kill on purpose. And he didn’t.

I am sorry that you found his example of abortion disgusting. What he was pointing out was how people are quick to say God isn’t just bc it appears he kills “innocent” ppl, but somehow people today are killing innocent ppl (aka abortions), but as always humans are really  good about coming up with “reasonable” excuses to justify the action. 

And i think you are wrong in inferring that he says to take the story not literally. If i remember correctly he focused on a specific word in the biblical text. So check that before u make the assumption.",303,6.13879E+17,0

"Okay, so you’re telling me god has justified genocide and many other of his atrocities because he gave a fare warning to the other ancient tribes? Wouldn’t a loving compassionate god not use violence? Like I’m telling you, this is man made. Man made to
promote fear and manipulate ancient men to following a specific religion. Ancient Aztecs and ancient tribes in the new world (north and South America) were committing these same things. Where was the Christian god then? It’s almost as if this story is used to promote a specific religion. 

And I understand the premise. OT god set laws for people to follow. People didn’t follow them so they suffered consequences. My point is why murder an entire tribe for not following your rules lol. That sounds man made. Why not come down and say, yo chill out and sacrificing babies (even tho that same Christian god told Abraham to do the exact same thing). It’s just so obvious that’s it man made and written by a first century man 😂😂 And even if it turns out that this Christian god was actually real, I wouldn’t wanna follow him bc of his atrocities.

God doesn’t give us or moral compass or conscience. That’s the indoctrination in you. The humans who were nice and conformed to their specific morals in their specific time reproduced more which created more humans who are moral. Nothing to do with god. 

And I feel uncomfortable with you always comparing me to your Christian god lol, that’s weird 😂 You think I’m more moral and just than him. This is what I think. I think that these stories from the Bible are so painstakingly clear that it was written by first century man who wanted power, that’s why it’s so barbaric. A passionate loving god wouldn’t be so barbaric even if he gave far warning. So you are mis-comparing me with your Christian god. It’s me vs first century men.

Lmk when ur done,303,6.13968E+17,1
So I can respond!,303,6.13968E+17,1
"And i am so sorry, but you are fundamentally incorrect in your interpretation of the OT scriptures. Therefore i cannot accept your claim about God being unjust or him condoning slavery, rape, and killing people, not only because i think you are not in a place to judge God (who is by the way, the standard for morality), but because you misunderstand God all together and his word in the OT. As expected, nonetheless. ",303,6.13968E+17,0
So let me educate you. Let me start out by stating the obvious: God does not not condone ANY of those things you mentioned nor is there evidence stating it ,303,6.13968E+17,0
"1. Slavery in the OT was not the slavery we know of today. Slavery in the biblical context was a form of servanthood that was VOLUNTARY and allowed these people to pay their debts off. And these people were to be set free every 7 years, but if the slave wanted to willingly stay with their master they could. In fact in exodus 21 we see that if anyone were to be kidnapped and sold to people, this was a crime, punishable by death. So again, not even remotely close to what slavery meant to america. Not even close.",303,6.13968E+17,0
"2. God does not condone Genocide. A genocide is the deliberate killing/ annihilation of all members of a defenseless ethnic or religious group, without reason. In the OT the taking over the land of the canaanites was an act of war, not genocide. Israelites were commanded to drive the canaanites out due to the atrocious evil, sexual immorality, and sins repeatedly committed for 400 years without desire to repent.",303,6.13968E+17,0
"3. God does not condone rape! in fact rape in the OT is equated to murder, and is again, punishable by death. Read Deuteronomy 21-23. It clearly lists out how rape should be handled and depicts when its actually rape, and when its adultery. When a women is raped the man is put to death. When it is consensual but the woman isnt married the man has to care for the women financially and cannot divorce her.  And there are more things covered in this area in those chapters but that is the gist of it.",303,6.13968E+17,0
"Now if there were some men of God that did any of those things, it does not mean God condoned it, rather it showed mens habitual sinful nature. The Bible illustrates how Gods men also sinned and when they sinned they were punished as well. ",303,6.13969E+17,0
"So where am i getting at? Stop taking biblical words and texts out of context and read it carefully. Just because there is a word like “slaverly” or “rape” in the story,  doesn’t mean God is condoning it.",303,6.13969E+17,0
Who is taking biblical text literally now? Interesting.... ,303,6.13969E+17,0
"So idc if i have to repeat myself again, but God IS just.",303,6.13969E+17,0
"God cannot violate his own nature. So, BECAUSE is JUST God MUST punish sin.",303,6.13969E+17,0
"God is Just bc he treats people according to that which is right. He judges people in proportion to the revelation that is given. In the Old testament, people saw God perform huge miracles and STILL, those miracles werent enough to turn them from their wicked ways",303,6.13969E+17,0
"SO, in return, the judgment towards the transgressor was as dramatic as those miracles they experienced to remind them, and remind us as the readers, that we are without excuse. He gives us inarguable evidence of his existence. The more evidence you have, the more that is expected of you. Gods grace is clearly seen in the OT as a form of love and the judgement expressed is born out of holiness. And those two aspects of God work together and come alive at the cross.",303,6.13969E+17,0
"Gods mercy and justice come together at the cross: 

1. justice was served by the punishing all sins of the world through death—death by an innocent human, Jesus Christ. He who knew no sin, became sin so we may become his righteousness",303,6.13969E+17,0
Wow you’re literally writing a book rn 😂😂 let’s practice on being concise and efficient ,303,6.13969E+17,1
Keep going tho,303,6.13969E+17,1
And don’t forget to lmk when you’re done!!,303,6.13969E+17,1
"2. A gift of grace and love is what we all now recieve as result of the cross. 

Now our debt as sinners is paid in full and we can draw near to Gods presence.

all of this makes sense when you see the progression from the OT to the NT. ",303,6.13969E+17,0

Ay perdón ,303,6.13969E+17,1
"Wait, was that it?",303,6.1397E+17,1
"So all that to say, God is consistent in the OT and the NT. Nothing has changed other than the fact that we are no longer bound by the law bc jesus came to abolish it.

Remember that God owes us nothing. Absolutely nothing. And as the supreme governor and ruler over HIS creation, he can give life and take life as he pleases. If you dont understand that, thats ok. We know you have a hard time accepting that there is a God anyway.  

I just think its funny that when it comes to certain things like abortion (for lack of a better example) you easily provide reasonable justifications for why it is acceptable in the larger scheme of things (like killing unborn babies to spare a mother from her misery or even the unborn child from its misery) but when it comes to God making such decisions about who lives and who doesn’t, suddenly he doesn’t have moral/reasonable justifications about why its the best decision to make for the people in its corresponding context.

"I’ll repeat your first two questions so you won’t have to scroll: 1) why would people die to defend the Bible? My answer: well, to begin, this was one of the questions that made me believe. It turns out people have died for way less. We gotta remember that the gospels were written 30-50 years after Jesus. So that was year 80. During those years people were so convinced that the resurrection was coming bc that’s what’s in these gospels. They literally thought the resurrection was coming very soon so that’s why they defended the Bible. Well it never came. Then we get the Roman emperor Constantine. Emperor Constantine made Christianity the official religion of Rome (which was still a huge empire back then). That right there was the biggest reason why the Bible and Christianity survived bc the emperor Constantine knew it was good politically. The Bible had to survive post 300s bc it was the law. So in essence, during the first years of the release of the gospels (80 ad - 300ish ad) the Bible survived bc people literally thought that this jesus man was coming back ASAP. Turned out he didn’t. Then from (300ish ad - 1600s) the church rules all of Europe so it had no choice to survive. And a quick note: just because a religion survived for a long time doesn’t mean it’s correct or real. The ancient Egyptian religion lasted for 3000 years, yet no one worships their gods anymore.",303,6.13971E+17,1
So that’s the answer to your first question ,303,6.13971E+17,1
Let me answe the second question you had ,303,6.13971E+17,1
And I’ll let u know when I’m done so you can reply lol,303,6.13971E+17,1
Your second question was: by what standard am I judging god by? My answer: the standard that I am judging him on is the current standard of morality and integrity that we have today.,303,6.13971E+17,1
And now I’m going to respond to your little soliloquy ,303,6.13971E+17,1
"Okay you say that I misunderstand the fundamentals of the OT. Then you also said that god was the standard for morality. We have to stop with this indoctrination that god is the entity who gave human beings morality and conscience. That it not true. I already told you once and I’ll tell you again. The very first humans, they had morality and a conscience. Those very first humans who acted upon their current morality in their own tribes tended to reproduce more. And so it went on. Humans who followed the morality of their tribes reproduced more which made more moral humans. It’s called natural selection. That’s how we have our morality today, it has nothing to do with god.",303,6.13971E+17,1
And now we get to the Bible part ,303,6.13971E+17,1
"It seems to me that this god can JUST about do whatever he wants and it’s okay. After all, if he’s so perfectly good, anything he does, by definition, is perfectly good because god did it. God can literally do no wrong according to you. I understand that you believe that. And I understand why such a thing that means so much to you, you would try and protect and reason out all the injustices that’s he’s done. 

Before I get into the Bible, you also said that I just see a controversial word (slave, rape, etc) and you assume I think it’s bad and not read the whole context. That’s false. I believed in this once you know. I hoped that it wasn’t what I thought it was but it is. I too hoped that god wasn’t as evil as the OT & NT makes him out to be but the context is there, you’re just trying to justify and rationalize your own truths to conform to your beliefs. 

You talked about slavery. I understand that slavery was different back then. But Yamz, it’s still slavery. Why would such an atrocity even be mentioned to casually in this supposedly holy book? You tell me, it’s not that KIND of slavery, but like I said, it’s still slavery. It doesn’t matter if it’s compassionate slavery and they got a break lmao, it’s still slavery 😂. This is just another example of you trying to justify an atrocity bc it has “the name of god” on it. I guarantee if you were alive in the 50s and 60s, your same convictions would be telling you that American slavery was justified by your Christian god. Bc the overwhelming majority of fundamentalist Christians like yourself, said that exact same thing. 

And then you talked about genocide and rape. I have already shown you scriptures were god literally tells his favorite tribe to go and ransack a city, kill all their people (even kids) and keep their virgins (to rape them). And there has been many other innocent killings that god has done. And I understand that you say, well it’s god, he can do whatever. Well that’s just bs. It’s so obvious that these stories were written by first century men, which is why I’m not worried about a murderous god watching over me. I wouldn’t wanna worship a god who has done all of these following things:

Genesis 7: floods the earth

Genesis 18-19: destroys cities and the kids inside of them who had nothing to do with anything

Exodus 7-12: god messed with the pharaoh and his people. God hardened the pharaohs heart on purpose. If he’s so powerful why not make the pharaoh let Moses and his people leave?

Exodus 32: god wants to kill his own tribe bc he got jealous that they started worshipping a golden calf. Moses convinces him to chill out tho. God then orders anyone “on the lord side” the murder their own families. WTH is that 

I mean I can go on and on with such atrocities 😂 I’m just very thankful that there’s minimal evidence for all of this. 

And you say that I am the one taking the Bible literally now. Indeed I am to prove a point to you. THE BIBLE SHOULDN’T BE TAKEN LITERALLY!!!! The original church, the Catholics, already said the the Bible shouldn’t be taken literally. The pope, who is the number one thing closest to god, according to the NT, says not to take the Bible literally. 

",303,6.13972E+17,1
I’m not done yet btw,303,6.13972E+17,1
"And idc how many times you repeat that your Christian god is just and the standard of morality 😂 scream it and repeat it as much as you want, it still won’t make it any less true 😂😂

And you brought up abortion. God has killed so many innocent people in the Bible which begs the question why do so many Christians care about innocent people today if their own god didn’t care about innocent people back then??

And abortion was just a political movement created by southern evangelicals to cause up a stir and create a political movement in order to keep their Christians schools segregated. It’s been documented that this is the sole reason why abortion and evangelicals go so tied up. Evangelicals didn’t care about abortion until the 1979, 6 years after roe v Wade. They have done everything in their power to convince people about abortions when their sole purpose is to gain power. It’s obvious this is true bc when you ask these same pro life ppl to contribute to social programs that help low income kids AFTER THEYRE BORN, they say no, too much $. It’s about power for them, not protecting the innocent. 

But I digress. I agree about the whole abortion thing with most evangelicals. Reduce the # of abortions but we just have different paths to get there.",303,6.13973E+17,1
And to finish off,303,6.13973E+17,1
"Idc how many times you tell me that god is just, our creator, moral standard, etc. The evidence to back those things are minimal. I have provided scripture where it shows that your god is vindictive, jealous, atrocious, etc. I will admit, however that there are parts where there are some good things in the Bible. Doesn’t make them any less real to fake just bc I like them tho. I explained to you how humans get our morals from humans, not from god. God has nothing to do with our morality. 

You just protect this god at all costs. You’re so indoctrinated that you can’t even fathom to EVEN TAKEN THE BIBLE AS ALLEGORY. It’s okay tho. It’s not your fault. You’re also so indoctrinated that you try to justify all of these horrific things in the Bible. You just seem to give god a pass anytime he commits such atrocities. I truly just find it sad. You went to college, they should have at least shown you in biology or your anthropology class that some of these things in the Bible are a little out there lol. I am not calling you dumb or anything. I actually think you’re very smart which makes make question even more why you still take the Bible literally. I can get the trying to defend your god when commits wrong. I can see why I would try to defend something I’ve known all my life which I didn’t have a choice to believe in. You were going to be a Christian whether you liked it or not bc of your parents, u just don’t realize that yet. The difference between me and you here is this: i read the Bible with an open mind. Everything I have learned in school (science, etc) I try to reconcile with the Bible. I think some of the things in the Bible are true. Did king David exist? Yes. Did he kill people and take all their foreskins? Very unlikely. I try to analyze everything with an open mind and not have a truth already set out before I read. You have been indoctrinated since you were a child to accept these things as 100% facts. And that’s okay. I am just here to show you that not all of these things are 100% fact. You are too smart for this. But then again, even some Harvard level smart people (very few) believe in the Bible literally. ",303,6.13973E+17,1
Okay I’m done lol,303,6.13973E+17,1
And just so u know I made a whole list of unjustified killings in the OT just in case you want them ,303,6.13974E+17,1

I have scripture to back up these claims the god is atrocious. Just say the word and they’re yours 😂. I’m just saying a loving and compassion god wouldn’t do these things. Clearly written by first century men ,303,6.13975E+17,1
"Forgot to add too to another atrocity of god is this: a typical American serial killer who rapes kids can have a change of heart on his death bed and make it to heaven. A kid in India or Afghanistan, according to ur “perfect holy book”, who doesn’t know the Christian god and got raped will not make it into heaven. It’s just so immoral",303,6.13976E+17,1

You dont believe in hell and thats ok,303,6.13976E+17,0
You dont have to worry about this anyway,303,6.13976E+17,0
The definition of Hell is eternal separation from God,303,6.13976E+17,0

Why be so cruel and test us,303,6.13976E+17,1
"This exist for people who deliberately choose to not be close with God it is also an expression of Gods justice.

"Only Christians who take the Bible literally tend to be uneducated people from 2nd or 3rd world countries. This is why I’m alway surprised that you, someone so smart, still believes in this literally. This is why I always point out the indoctrination. ",303,6.13978E+17,1
I’ll give u an example of indoctrination ,303,6.13978E+17,1
"There was this dude from Harvard, he was a geologist who was suppose to be the next big geologist. He was learning under the best geologist professor and he was bound to over take him and be the next big thing. When he was about to do that, he couldn’t reconcile his beliefs with he geology. He decided to go with his beliefs and complete drop his geological duties. He could have contributed so much to the world, but he chose the words of the Bible instead. ",303,6.13978E+17,1
"You might find that sublime, but it’s really isn’t. The idea of this literalism stole this dude’s education and contribution to the world ",303,6.13978E+17,1
But I guess it’s his choice tho,303,6.13978E+17,1

"You’ve said “I only date Christians”.  That in itself is imposing your beliefs on anyone who is interested in you (not saying that that was why I became Christian in the first place btw). So, yes, just by saying those words, you have imposed your beliefs. 

And I know you believe in it. That’s fine lol, I have already made all the points that I wanted to say. I just hope one day you realize not everything in the Bible is literal. That’s my only hope for you lol",303,6.13979E+17,1

Oh gawdddddd,303,6.1398E+17,0
I starting believing in Christianity again (I believed as a kid bc Catholic parents lol) because I read what Jesus said and did. I like that a lot. You also played a small part in it too lol but it was mostly jesus ideas. But I have now figured out just because most of his teaching are good ideas doesn’t make them any more true or fake,303,6.1398E+17,1
Shocked about what? 😂,303,6.1398E+17,1

sacalo ya di la verdad,303,6.1398E+17,0
😂😂😂,303,6.1398E+17,0
"That’s an indirect way of imposing your beliefs on someone. Let’s say I have a belief that I only date laker fans. This girls comes along and she’s interested in me. I tell her I only date laker fans. She will start watching the lakers to see what’s the big idea about people who only date laker fans.

I’m not saying that that’s why I become Christian. At least not the sole purpose. Like I told you up above, I become Christian because I loved what Jesus taught (except for the eternal punishment of you don’t listen lol). It was 98% jesus 1% knowledge of the Bible and 1% you bc I had an interest in you. And now I have come to the conclusion that just because Jesus said some nice things that I like, doesn’t really prove he’s the son of god. 

And no I am not bitter that you prefer Christmas dudes lol. You have your preferences, I have my own 😂",303,6.1398E+17,1

"Lol false assumptions there. I have tested and tried my faith. Read the scripture. Challenged my own parents on things rhey themselves have misunderstood. Disagreed with the way they have attempted to raise me. Maybe when i was little i followed everything they said. But as i have grown and experiences the world and actually put to practice what my faith asks of me, and wrestles with things that i do not understand, i have still come to understand way more than you have from being a christian for not even a full year.",303,6.13981E+17,0

￼What do you think of this,303,6.14201E+17,0
I think having DACA stay is amazing and all but it doesn’t solve the problem. It seems to me that trump was tryna do something about a legal pathway to citizenship through a bi-partisan deal but no one want to give Trump credit if a Bill is passed.,303,6.14202E+17,0
Just my thoughts,303,6.14202E+17,0
"Well a couple things here:

1) you’re absolutely right. Trump can still end daca if he wants. He needs to provide a solid reason of why he’s doing it (which is why the Supreme Court ruled in our favor bc he didn’t say why, or at least not good enough of a legal reason)

2) trump has had MULTIPLE opportunities to not only reinstate daca but also multiple opportunities to provide pathway to citizenship

Prime example: one of trumps biggest campaign promise was to build the wall. Democrats said no bc we are going to pay for it. Democrats finally give in and say okay, we’ll give you 25 BILLION DOLLARS for your wall but you provide pathway to citizenship to dreamers. Trump agreed at first. He later changed his mind. In the end, a couple months later, trump ended up with 3 billion for the wall and we ended up with nothing. I’ll provide a link for the story. 

Trump doesn’t want to help dreamers. He wants to use us a political chip to advance his own agenda. If this were not the case, he would’ve done something by now. And I disagree with you that trump was trying to get a  bi-partisan deal for us. There has been bi-partisan support for us already (like the link will show), except the president always ends up backing out. 

And last thing. No one is so selfish as to not pass help for dreamers all because I would make trump “look good”. Many Democrats themselves (like the link will say) would put their egos aside and do the right thing. 

Here is the link. Please read it:",303,6.14205E+17,1
https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/01/democrats-schumer-trump-border-wall-daca/551288/,303,6.14205E+17,1
And to add to number one up there. Trumps effort to end daca is most likely over. Any effort again will take such a long time that we will have a new president in office so it doesn’t matter,303,6.14205E+17,1
Yea but there is a bipartisan for getting DACA students leadership but the senate leadership refuses to take it up anyway ,303,6.14206E+17,0
So its whatever ,303,6.14206E+17,0

"Well, In the senate, the bill needs 60 votes to pass. There’s a total of 100 senators. Last time they did this it was 6 votes shy of passing. So there’s definitely bi-partisan support, just need a couple more people ",303,6.14206E+17,1

But we’re not a priority tbh. There are many other issues they need to worry about first ,303,6.14206E+17,1
"Well actually idk, we might be a priory lol Idk. There’s just so much works that’s going to have to be done when uncle joe steps in",303,6.14206E+17,1

"Okay, well I will do a better job",303,6.14383E+17,1
It’s hard sometimes tho cause our views on quite the opposite so we are bound to have some uncomfortableness lol,303,6.14383E+17,1
Feels like everything you tend to bring up always ends up in some accusations toward my “religion” ,303,6.14383E+17,0
"But I will try, I promise ",303,6.14383E+17,1
Even if its jokingly,303,6.14383E+17,0
No more low blows or any of that ,303,6.14383E+17,1
Yea but i never personally attack you in that sense,303,6.14383E+17,0

Ans i state it,303,6.14383E+17,0
Eehhh you attack me sometimes lol,303,6.14383E+17,1
But its not phrased in a verbal attack or in a way to persuade you to believe something contrary to what you believ,303,6.14383E+17,0
But I admit I may be harsher sometimes ,303,6.14383E+17,1
Yea well when you attatck its gonna happwn,303,6.14383E+17,0
What do you expect,303,6.14383E+17,0
But you do try to persuade kinda ,303,6.14383E+17,1
No,303,6.14383E+17,0
I defens my position,303,6.14383E+17,0
"I give you facts, you reply with the religious beliefs, I get a little frustrated and provide more facts, u provide more religious beliefs lol, that’s how it goes 😂",303,6.14383E+17,1
I see ,303,6.14383E+17,0
"But you’re right tho, I need to come across better",303,6.14383E+17,1
I will work on that,303,6.14383E+17,1
well thats what defending my religion is. I am the christian. You aren’t ,303,6.14383E+17,0
And I’m sorry for attacking u and making u feel uncomfortable :/,303,6.14383E+17,1
"Exactly, yes",303,6.14383E+17,1
Alright then,303,6.14383E+17,0
It’s just hard for me sometimes that people just reject scientific facts that I’ve known since high school :/,303,6.14383E+17,1
But I’ll be better,303,6.14383E+17,1
A lot of the things you brought up are political or sociological ,303,6.14383E+17,0
If by science you are talking about evolution thats one thing,303,6.14383E+17,0
Well that’s cause I like to good your views on stuff too sometimes ,303,6.14383E+17,1
Then I give you my views ,303,6.14383E+17,1
Get*,303,6.14383E+17,1
It seems like you like to know my views to later attack them,303,6.14383E+17,0
Wow lol,303,6.14383E+17,1
No,303,6.14383E+17,1
I only attack one thing,303,6.14383E+17,1
That’s the Bible literalism ,303,6.14383E+17,1
I don’t attack you your political views or whatever ,303,6.14383E+17,1
Like yesterday or whenever it was,303,6.14383E+17,1
You told me about how people are out to get trump so that’s why daca is how it is now. You said they don’t want trump to do anything “good”. Then I provided u with facts from both liberal and conservative media stating that that was not the case ,303,6.14384E+17,1
"So no, I only attack you on the Biblical literalism lol",303,6.14384E+17,1
"But like I said lol, I’ll be better",303,6.14384E+17,1
I promise ,303,6.14384E+17,1
Lol i dont think i considered yesterday’s conversation “an attack”,303,6.14384E+17,0
I asked for your opinion and you states it,303,6.14384E+17,0
I told you my opinion and then asked for yours,303,6.14384E+17,0
When do I attack you then?? Did I attack you today?,303,6.14385E+17,1
Lol in general you attack,303,6.14385E+17,0
feels like you are always ready to ,303,6.14385E+17,0
"Can I just say something, and I promise I’ll try to say it nicely",303,6.14385E+17,1
and today when you brought up the whole judging and then turn it into some religion joke and how you are not the one being held accountable or whatever that to me is like ok... whats this dudes problem,303,6.14385E+17,0
"If I didn’t attack you on your claim that the earth was young, you would’ve never found out it’s actually pretty old!!! I’m pretty sure you agree that we can have disagreements and we’ll still be cool with each other. I feel like I just need to work on getting my point across while not being a jerk. So my point it: I hope it’s okay to challenge your beliefs and you challenge mine. Beliefs are meant to be challenged, that’s how we grow. But I will try to be nicer about it",303,6.14385E+17,1
I never said you shouldnt,303,6.14385E+17,0
Emphasized “and today when you brought up the whole judging and then turn it into some religion joke and how you are not the one being held accountable or whatever that to me is like ok... whats this dudes problem”,303,6.14385E+17,1
Asking questions,303,6.14385E+17,0
And all that ,303,,
,,,
0,14B8D9A1-E2C2-4764-AD59-220D85C23B28,0,0
Thats normal,303,6.14385E+17,0
But out of all people and friends i know rhat are not religious ,303,6.14385E+17,0
No ones “attacked” like you have ,303,6.14385E+17,0
They are always respectful ,303,6.14385E+17,0
Okay but how many of them have been religious first then not religious?,303,6.14385E+17,1
We actually converse and listen,303,6.14385E+17,0
How many of them deconverted?,303,6.14385E+17,1
"Just probably me, right? 🙄",303,6.14385E+17,1
😂*,303,6.14385E+17,1
"Does it really matter? They are not religious, or they come from religious parents and domt consider themselves religious",303,6.14385E+17,0
So that’s why I’m sometimes so eager to share my thoughts ,303,6.14385E+17,1
"Cause I use to think like you kinda but now I don’t, and I just wanna share my thoughts to maybe help you understand from a different perspective ",303,6.14385E+17,1
"But like I said, I gotta be nicer about it",303,6.14385E+17,1
You get my reasoning?,303,6.14385E+17,1
"And I’d rather you have to hear the common scientific consensus, rather than just being polite and let it slide. 

Like I remember a long time ago you told me that dinosaurs and humans co-existed (this was a very long time ago lol) and I didn’t say anything, just let it slide. 

Now if you were to tell me that, I would tell you something. Hopefully now, I will tell you in a nicely cordial way lol",303,6.14385E+17,1
"A lot of christians disagree within each other about the things you have always brought up :evolution, homosexuality, politics, etc. So in a sense its not always what you believe vs what i believe. Ppl disagree about these things all the time but they don’t interfere with faith in God",303,6.14387E+17,0
"But the way you “challenge” my beliefs, it seems, is to doubt my existence in a God in the first place. ",303,6.14387E+17,0
Thats just what i have noticed in the way you bring things up,303,6.14387E+17,0
"I am not trying to make you doubt your faith lol, at least no on purpose. I just say those things because that’s what I personally believe (like i truly believe the Bible is barbaric, no offense). My goal isn’t for you to doubt your faith at all (cause let’s be honest, that’s impossible in the first place lol). My main goal for you is just to make you see a different perspective. 

And you’re probably asking, “well why do u care about my personal perspective?”

That’s bc I’ve never met a girl who went to church 3-4 times a week and thought that was normal lol. I know you might not like me saying this, but I’ll try to say it in a nice way. You are heavily influenced by this faith (which can be good and bad) so all I’m trying to do is give you more perspective and make you hear some things that you may have not heard before. At the end of the day, idc what or who you worship to lol. You’re a good loving person but I just want you to have more perspective than just faith all the time",303,6.14388E+17,1
And you can ask me to stop giving you a different perspective if you want lol,303,6.14388E+17,1
There would be no hard feelings,303,6.14388E+17,1
"And I also hope you understand, which I think
You already do, why you belief in the first place ",303,6.14388E+17,1
"Well thats exactly it you think bc my parents went to church and i went at a young age, i am indoctrinated and cant see the reason why i believe in the first place",303,6.14389E+17,0
But i have already told you why i believ and it had to do with way more than just my family going to church,303,6.14389E+17,0
Because as you can see ,303,6.14389E+17,0
Theres a lot in their culty like church that i have had to consider and doubt and reflect on for me to come to where i am now,303,6.14389E+17,0
I believe in God bc of my personal life and experience,303,6.14389E+17,0
And i have met other Christians and other non christians ,303,6.14389E+17,0
Interacted with and argued with others from a different background and culture ,303,6.14389E+17,0
Also seen how many ppl crave spirituality when they are at the verge of death,303,6.14389E+17,0
Hospitals have shown me a lot ,303,6.14389E+17,0
"So yes, I understand why I believe in the first place",303,6.14389E+17,0
"Lol, no, I don’t think that just bc you grew up in a church, you have your faith. Do I think going 3-4 times a week is a little excessive? Yes. But here’s the very main thing I worry about: you grew up in a church who’s ideas are kinda out there to say the least. I’m saying that you grew up in this church with its crazy ideas. I don’t need to explain the crazy ideas of your church lol, you already know.

My biggest concern is that you might still believe some of these ideas that your church may have taught you at a young age. I grew up in a Catholic Church lol and never believed that humans and dinosaurs co-existed (that’s just done example). But you’re absolutely correct, you have come a far way even since I’ve met you lol. My thing is this, you can still go even further. Not further away from god lol but further into having a less extremist faith. And I know you probably won’t like that term, but that’s the term I have to use. I don’t want to convince you/change your faith, that’s messed up. I just want you to be less extreme about it. 

And I’m glad working in hospitals have shown you many things. And yes, people sometimes do repent and wish they were religious on their death beds because we humans are scared to die. It’s a natural human feeling!

So my main points are these lol: yes, I understand you have come a long way from your church’s teachings. I’m just saying you can do better. And better doesn’t mean straying away from your faith, if anything, it’ll be stronger lol",303,6.1439E+17,1
Lol well how do you know if i actually listened ,303,6.1439E+17,0
Or that i used to help kids with Sunday school,303,6.1439E+17,0
Cause I’ve heard you say some outlandish stuff lol,303,6.1439E+17,1

How so,303,6.14472E+17,0
Lol it doesn’t matter what I think. Just keep doing you!! I’m turning a page on this whole religious discussion thing. Seems like our passions for religion and non-religion discussions have kind of made our friendship not as affectionate as before lol. ,303,6.14474E+17,1

The enemy of my enemy is my friend?,303,6.14486E+17,0

You might have trouble with the last question in this section 😂,303,6.14487E+17,1
"After this section, the questions are super easy",303,6.14487E+17,1
A genuine free market requires restrictions on the ability of predator multinationals to create monopolie,303,6.14487E+17,0
Yea this one^,303,,

"Is it okay for companies to monopolize, like instead of having multiple phone companies (Verizon, att, t mobile, etc) should we just have one?",303,6.14487E+17,1
Should that  he allowed in free markets?,303,6.14487E+17,1
Be*,303,6.14487E+17,1
Oh ok,303,6.14487E+17,0
So pretty much should free markets restrict monopolies ,303,6.14487E+17,1
What does commercial basis mean,303,6.14487E+17,0
What’s the question?,303,6.14487E+17,1
Taxpayers should not be expected to prop up any theatres or museums that cannot survive on a commercial basis.,303,6.14487E+17,0
"So, do you think taxes from ppl should help museums and theaters even those those museums and theaters lose money ",303,6.14488E+17,1

"No broadcasting institution, however independent its content, should receive public funding",303,6.14488E+17,0

Should independent radios stations or tv channels receive money from the government ,303,6.14488E+17,1
No public radio stations or public tv channels (like pbs) should receive government money? Agree or disagree ,303,6.14488E+17,1
Pretty much should there be government paid broadcasting institutions that are independent lol,303,6.14488E+17,1
